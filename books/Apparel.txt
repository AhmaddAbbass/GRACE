Instructions: Examine the garment where your ribbon button came off. There should be a little pocket where the ribbon came out. Stitch rip the seam around the little pocket until it is large enough to easily slide the ribbon in. Tuck one end of the ribbon into the pocket, inserting the ribbon past the missing seam. If you are are using a ribbon that has an obvious front and back, insert the ribbon so that the back is facing out. Holding the ribbon in place, slide the garment into the sewing machine, aligning the [[Sewing Glossary#Section_Presser_Foot|presser foot]] with the place you want the button to sit. Do not sew the pocket with the ribbon end in it closed. Sew the ribbon in place. (Tools used: sewing machine) [[Sewing Glossary#Section_Backstitch|Backstitch]] to hold the stitches in place. Lift the presser foot and remove the garment from the sewing machine. Clip any threads. (Tools used: sewing machine) Thread the ribbon through the button coming up from behind, over the spoke in the middle, and back down through the second hole. Pull the ribbon taught. The button should be facing with the backside out. Fold the button and ribbon back over, so that the other side of the button is facing out. Leave just enough ribbon to tuck into the little pocket. Clip all excess ribbon. Fold the free end of the ribbon, tucking it into the little pocket, in the same manner as the first. Overlap the two ends of the ribbon so that they sit directly on top of one another. Sew directly over the seam, closing the little pocket. This seam should catch both ends of the ribbon between the two layers of the pocket. Backstitch to hold the seam in place. Remove the garment from the sewing machine. (Tools used: sewing machine) Clip any threads. Admire your handiwork.

Guide: How to remove scratches from a Breitling Navitimer sapphire watch face.
Domain hierarchy 1: Watch. Domain hierarchy 2: Apparel. Domain hierarchy 3: Root.
Category: Breitling Navitimer. Subject: Not specified.
Tools required: rotary tool, diamond paste 3 different grades, felt dremel tip, polishing cloth.
Instructions: '''NOTICE THE HORRIBLE SCRATCH ON MY BREITLING NAVITIMER AROUND THE 12 HAND, it's actually a borderline crack. ''' You WILL NEED all of the following: diamond paste - 3 different grades A hand held Dremel tool using felt tip. You can try to use a papertowel and buff the face but it doesn't knock out the job like a Dremel. I bought mine at Walmart for $25 dollars. (Tools used: felt dremel tip, diamond paste 3 different grades) First, remove your watch band from your watch. After you have removed your watch band from the watch case. Next step is to remove the bezel from the casing. Take butter knife from your kitchen and slide it between the watch case and bezel and pry it up as you twist. You will feel a pop and the bezel will be freed from the watch case. Place your watch dial in the watch case under a cup or dust protector to avoid getting dust and lint on your watch. Rather than removing the glass from the bezel, I just left it in. It is advisable to always remove the glass completely, but I did not as the materials being used will not harm the bezel. Exercise caution and do not rush yourself. You will have three different grade diamond pastes.  I use a 6, 3, 1... It's always better to do a 6, 3, .25 The lowest grade diamond paste is good for refinishing with a glossy mirror finish. (Tools used: diamond paste 3 different grades) Start with level 6 diamond paste You will apply about a dime size of paste, then using your finger to spread the paste evenly around the watch face. After spreading out the diamond paste, turn your Dremel on its lowest speed and apply the felt tip to the watch face. IMPORTANT: rotate the Dremel in circular motions as you work around the sapphire. DO NOT press to hard or Dremel too long on a specific area, it could crack your face. Take little 20 second breaks allowing the face to cool down, if it over heats it could be many problems. You will repeat the same steps above for each grade of diamond paste. Apply a little more pressure on the really scratched area to get better results. NOTE* when you press harder on specific areas using your Dremel make sure your not overheating the crystal, it can heat up in a matter of 5 seconds. Touch the area scratched often to ensure its cool. (Tools used: felt dremel tip, diamond paste 3 different grades) After removing the scratches from your watch face, then snap your bezel back on and re-attach your links. Lastly, I used some car wax on my watch face to give it that gleem. I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend getting some cape cod cloths. They are AMAZING. Wipe down your wrist band with this and it will remove scratches and polish your watch. The RESULT = PERFECTION! Hope you enjoyed this tutorial. Notice the scratch on my Breitling is completely gone! (Tools used: polishing cloth)

Guide: Zig-zag Patch.
Domain hierarchy 1: Patagonia Bottoms. Domain hierarchy 2: Bottoms. Domain hierarchy 3: Clothing. Domain hierarchy 4: Apparel. Domain hierarchy 5: Root.
Category: Patagonia Jeans. Subject: Not specified.
Tools required: sewing machine, utility scissors, measuring tape, tailor s chalk.
Instructions: Examine the damage. Clip any long, loose threads, and remove any debris from the hole. Measure the length and width of the hole. In our case it looks like 2" by 1". Grab a scrap of denim or other heavy-weight fabric and mark your measurements plus one inch in each direction. In our case it will be 3" by 2". Cut the scrap into a rectangle the dimensions of your new measurements. Insert the rectangle of fabric into the jean leg and position it under the hole. Be sure that you put the rectangle of fabric in the pant leg and not behind it—you only want to work on one layer of fabric. Thread your sewing machine with your desired thread color. Slide the pant leg onto the arm of the sewing machine. You may need to remove the sewing machine table for the pant leg to fit over the arm. Be sure that the pant leg is around the arm of the sewing machine. If both layers are stacked on one another, you will sew the pant leg shut. (Tools used: sewing machine) Check that the rectangle of fabric is still laying flat, centered beneath the hole. Lower the pressor foot. Sew a straight line over the hole going about five stitches past the damage. Lift the pressor foot. Rotate the jean leg a few degrees toward the center of the hole. Lower the pressor foot. Engage the backstitch function on your sewing machine, and sew a straight line back over the hole, going about five stitches beyond the damage. (Tools used: sewing machine) Repeat steps five and six, continuing to rotate and sew lines of stitching back and forth until you cover the entire hole. When you are satisfied with your stitching, backstitch two or three stitches. Lift the needle and pressor foot. Slide the jean leg off of the sewing machine. (Tools used: sewing machine) Clip any dangling threads and admire your work. Still not satisfied? Alrighty, let's add some decorative stitching the other way. This is completely optional. If you are happy with your work, you can stop here. Slide the pant leg back onto the arm of the sewing machine, making sure that the leg goes around the arm. (Tools used: sewing machine) Carefully rotate the jean leg 90 degrees. Be sure that there is only one layer of fabric (plus the rectangle) between the sewing machine and the needle, or else you will sew the pant leg shut. (Tools used: sewing machine) Lower the pressor foot. Sew a straight line of stitching over the damaged area. Just like before, at the end of each line of stitching, lift the pressor foot, rotate the jeans a few degrees, and sew another line of stitching. When you are happy with the way that the stitching looks, backstitch two or three stitches. Lift the pressor foot and needle. Slide the pant leg off the arm of the sewing machine. (Tools used: sewing machine) Clip any dangling threads.

Guide: Reverse Applique Patch.
Domain hierarchy 1: Patagonia Bottoms. Domain hierarchy 2: Bottoms. Domain hierarchy 3: Clothing. Domain hierarchy 4: Apparel. Domain hierarchy 5: Root.
Category: Patagonia Jeans. Subject: Not specified.
Tools required: sewing machine, utility scissors, measuring tape.
Instructions: Examine the damage. Clip any long threads, and remove any debris from the hole. Measure the damaged area. In our case it looks to be 2" by 2". Draw any the shape you'd like your patch to be on a piece of paper. Be sure your design is at least 1/8" larger than the damaged area. Cut out your design. Lay the cutout of your design over the hole in the jeans to make sure that it is the correct size and looks how you want it to. Using a pencil, pen, or tailor's chalk, trace the design onto the jeans. Cut the design out of your jeans. Be sure to only cut one layer of denim, or you will cut through the back of your jeans and need two patches! Take the scrap of fabric you will use for a patch and insert it into the hole. Slide the pant leg with the patch over the arm of the sewing machine. You may need to remove the sewing machine table for the pant to fit over the sewing machine. If you are still having trouble getting the pant around the arm of the sewing machine, you can rip the side seam of the pant leg to allow room to sew. Be sure that the pant leg is around the arm, and that you are not accidentally sewing the two layers of the pant leg together. (Tools used: sewing machine) Adjust the sewing machine for a zig-zag stitch. Set the stitch length to just under 1/2. (Tools used: sewing machine) Align the edge of the patch with the center of the pressor foot. Be sure that the patch is laying flat. Lower the pressor foot. Begin sewing the zig-zag stitch, following the edge of the hole so that the zig-zag stitch covers the area where the two fabrics meet. (Tools used: sewing machine) Sew all the way around the patch. Overlap the stitching at the end with the first two or three stitches. Lift the pressor foot and needle. Slide the pant leg off of the arm of the sewing machine. Clip any threads, and admire your work. (Tools used: sewing machine)

Guide: Eyeglasses Spring Hinge Screw Replacement.
Domain hierarchy 1: Apparel. Domain hierarchy 2: Root.
Category: Eyeglasses. Subject: Spring Hinge Screw.
Tools required: pin, tweezers, 64 bit driver kit.
Instructions: These are the tools I used to insert the screw through the spring hinge. In the video a paperclip was used, but the paperclip I had on-hand could not fit into the tiny recess in order to jam the spring open. The problem at hand: The screw will not fit through the arm because a spring is pulling on the hinge (and screw hole) in the arm. Insert a pushpin through the hole and use it as leverage to extend the spring hinge outwards. Be careful not to push the pushpin into your finger, as opposed to the small notch that you've just uncovered. Once the spring hinge extends outward with the first pushpin, use a second pushpin to keep the hole in the "extended" position: There will be a small notch revealed once the spring hinge extends outwards. Wedge the second pushpin into that notch so that the hinge doesn't go back inwards. I sadly only have two hands, so I was not able to show how to wedge the pushpin ''and'' take the photo. With the second pushpin hanging around, line up the eyeglass frame/arm holes together. Use a pair of tweezers to insert your eyeglass screw through both holes. (Tools used: tweezers) Finally, use a 1.2 mm flat-blade screwdriver to secure the arm to the frame. Presto-blamo! Your eyeglasses are fixed. The same procedure can be used on sunglasses without any problems.

Guide: Hemming Pants.
Domain hierarchy 1: Bottoms. Domain hierarchy 2: Clothing. Domain hierarchy 3: Apparel. Domain hierarchy 4: Root.
Category: Patagonia Bottoms. Subject: Not specified.
Tools required: sewing pins, 6 inch metal ruler, sewing machine, utility scissors, fabric scissors.
Instructions: Begin by assessing the pants' current length. This is best done by wearing the pants along with an appropriate pair of shoes. Wearing pants barefoot or with high heels will affect their length relative to the floor. It's helpful to have a second person assist with this step and the two that follow. Fold the cuff of one pant leg inward, and adjust it to the desired length. Insert two or three pins to hold the cuff in position. The pins should be placed parallel to the new fold. With the pins in place, verify that the length is correct. Make any final adjustments to the length as needed. (Tools used: sewing pins) On a flat, clean surface, lay the pants down on their side with the newly shortened pant leg on top. Using a ruler, note the distance from the  edge of the old cuff to the edge of the new cuff. Repeat the measurement several times along the width of the cuff, making sure the new hemline is perfectly even. (Tools used: 6 inch metal ruler) Thread the sewing machine, using a thread color that matches your garment's fabric as closely as possible. Sewing machine setup varies from one model to another. Consult your sewing machine manual for precise instructions. Place the first cuff on the sewing machine, and position the sewing needle between one of your pins and the edge of the cuff. (Tools used: sewing machine) Gently depress the foot pedal and begin sewing. Be sure the needle penetrates the pant leg on only one side. It may be easier to position the pant leg around the arm of the sewing machine with the table removed. If you sew through both layers, you will sew the pant leg shut! Pause when you reach a pin, and remove it before continuing. Do not attempt to sew over any pins. Hitting a pin can bend or break the sewing machine needle. (Tools used: sewing pins, sewing machine, sewing) Continue sewing all the way around the cuff, until you reach the first few stitches. Sew over the first few stitches to prevent the stitches from unraveling. (Tools used: sewing) Raise the presser foot, and remove the pants from the sewing machine. Clip any threads. (Tools used: sewing machine) Turn the cuff over so that the extra length of the hem folds out. Clip the extra length, leaving about a half inch of fabric beyond the seam. Be sure to only cut through one layer of the fabric—the excess fabric. Do not cut through the pants. This step is optional. If you are hemming pants for a growing kiddo, leaving the excess length allows you to rip the seam and magically lengthen the pants later on. (Tools used: fabric scissors, 6 inch metal ruler) Set your sewing machine to a zigzag stitch. Insert the freshly cut edge of the hem into the sewing machine. Be sure to only insert one layer of fabric—the hem—or you will sew through the outer, visible layers of the pants. (Tools used: sewing machine) Sew around the hem, as close to the edge as possible. Zigzagging the edge prevents the edge from unraveling. Lift the presser foot and remove the pants from the sewing machine. Clip any excess threads. (Tools used: sewing machine)

Guide: How To Repair A Baffle On A Patagonia Down Jacket.
Domain hierarchy 1: Patagonia Outerwear. Domain hierarchy 2: Outerwear. Domain hierarchy 3: Clothing. Domain hierarchy 4: Apparel. Domain hierarchy 5: Root.
Category: Patagonia Down Jacket. Subject: Not specified.
Tools required: utility scissors, sewing pins, sewing machine, iron, tenacious tape, seam ripper, measuring tape.
Instructions: Locate the hole in your down jacket. In order to prevent all the feathers from escaping through the hole, you'll have to replace the entire baffle. Cut a small oval of Tenacious Tape large enough cover the hole. (Tools used: tenacious tape) Peel the backing off the tape, and apply it to the hole. (Tools used: tape) Use a seam ripper to rip the [[Sewing Glossary#Section_Seam|seam]] at the end of baffle that needs a repair. In this case, the nearest seam is along the sleeve. Rip a large segment of the seam, so that the jacket is comfortable to work with. (Tools used: seam ripper) Turn the jacket inside out. Measure the width of the baffle you're working on. In this case, each baffle looks like it is two inches wide. We are replacing two baffles, so we will need just over four inches of fabric to patch. Measure the length of the baffle (along the baffle seam). In our case, the baffle length is nine inches, and since our repair is in the sleeve, we will double this to eighteen inches for the length of our scrap. (Tools used: seam ripper) Get a scrap of matching fabric to patch the baffle. Make sure you have enough fabric to cover the area you measured in the previous step, with an inch or two extra in each direction. We are using a piece of fabric that is slightly lighter than our jacket, so you can easily identify which areas we are working on. Fold one of the long edges of the fabric over so that it is straight. Iron the fold into place. (Tools used: iron) Align the folded edge of the scrap along the outermost seam on the baffle you want to replace. Be sure the rough, folded-over fabric is between the baffle with the hole and the new scrap of fabric. Align the folded edge of the baffle with the seam, and pin it into place. (Tools used: seam ripper, sewing pins) Set the pinned piece into the sewing machine. Be sure to use the smallest needle you can find to patch this baffle. This will keep the new stitch from looking too prominent and help prevent the down from escaping through the new stitching holes. Sew directly over the old baffle seam. You will be sewing very close to the edge of the fold, just catching the fabric. If you’re working on a sleeve, make sure you only have one layer of the sleeve and that you’re not sewing the entire sleeve shut. Go slowly, and guide the folded edge of the fabric directly over the old baffle seam. You may have to realign the folded edge of the fabric as you go—that's okay. (Tools used: seam ripper, sewing machine, sewing) While you're sewing, be sure to hold the [[Sewing Glossary#Section_Bias_Tape|bias tape]] (which covered the seam edge) out of the way so that it doesn't get caught in the seam. Continue to carefully sew the fold into place. The fabric is very slippery, so be careful and take your time. Judge the seam to your liking. When you come to the end of the seam, [[Sewing Glossary#Section_Backstitch|backstitch]] to keep your thread in place. (Tools used: seam ripper, sewing) We are working with three baffle seams in total. You've already sewn one at the outer edge. Skipping the baffle seam in the middle, pin the second fold into place on the seam at the other outer edge. Sew the second seam as you did the first. (Tools used: seam ripper) Continue sewing. When you are finished, your jacket should look like the second image. (Tools used: sewing) Turn the jacket right-side out again so you can see the original baffle stitching. Be sure to flip the bias tape out of the inside of the seam so it doesn't get caught as you continue to sew. Align your presser foot on top of the untouched, middle seam (between the two seams you've already sewed). (Tools used: seam ripper, tenacious tape) Sew directly over the original middle baffle stitching between the two seams you just made. Be sure to hold the bias tape out of the way. (Tools used: seam ripper, tape) Trim off the excess fabric. For our repair of the sleeve, we need to realign the sleeve seam that we ripped. Pull the bias tape out of the way. Sew the sleeve seam closed, backstitching at the beginning and end of the seam. (Tools used: seam ripper, tape) Replace the bias tape over the completed sleeve seam. Adjust it so it sits correctly on both sides of the seam. (Tools used: seam ripper, tenacious tape) Sew the bias tape back on. Make sure you sew as close to the inside edge of the bias tape as possible. Backstitch at both ends of the seam. (Tools used: seam ripper, tape) Inspect your seams. Make sure that everything is in place, clip your threads, and be very proud of yourself. That was a tough repair. (Tools used: seam ripper)

Guide: Patch a Patagonia Down Jacket with Repair Tape.
Domain hierarchy 1: Patagonia Outerwear. Domain hierarchy 2: Outerwear. Domain hierarchy 3: Clothing. Domain hierarchy 4: Apparel. Domain hierarchy 5: Root.
Category: Patagonia Down Jacket. Subject: Not specified.
Tools required: utility scissors, tenacious tape.
Instructions: Inspect the damage. Clip any dangling threads, fabric, or feathers using small scissors. . Do not pull feathers out with your finger. Pulling feathers encourages more feathers to come out the hole and makes the problem worse. (Tools used: utility scissors) Clean the fabric area that you are repairing with Isopropyl alcohol  prior to applying  the patch. This will remove dirt and oil  allowing the adhesive to bond well to the fabric.  Allow fabric to dry for a short period before adhering the patch Grab your repair tape. Flip the repair tape to the back side. Using a permanent marker, draw an oval slightly larger than the hole. If you have a wide hole, you can use a rectangle, but be sure to round the edges. Rounding the edges prevents the corners from getting caught and peeling up. (Tools used: tenacious tape) Cut out your shape using scissors. (Tools used: utility scissors) Lay the shape over the hole to ensure that the patch is large enough. You want the patch to be reach the fabric on all sides with at least an 1/8" of overlap. Using your fingernail, or a pin, peel the backing off the repair tape, so that you only have the clear sticky layer. Be sure not to touch the sticky side, as this will gum up the tape and it will not stick well. (Tools used: tenacious tape) Lay the tape over the hole and press the tape down with your finger. (Tools used: tenacious tape) Use a fingernail or a spudger to work all of the air out of the tape, rubbing it  and pressing down on it with a warm palm until it is well-adhered. (Tools used: tenacious tape)

Category: Patagonia Down Jacket. Subject: Main Zipper.
Tools required: measuring tape, utility scissors, seam ripper, sewing machine, tailor s chalk, end nippers, needlenose pliers, sewing pins, fabric scissors.
Instructions: Unzip the jacket and fold back the bottom corner. Identify the start of the seam that is holding the zipper in place. (Tools used: seam ripper) Using a seam ripper, gently remove the stitches on the inside of the zipper. Be careful not to accidentally puncture or tear the jacket. (Tools used: seam ripper) Bend the zipper teeth away from the zipper webbing to make it easier to reach the stitches that hold the zipper and webbing together. Using the seam ripper, gently rip the seam between the zipper and zipper webbing. (Tools used: seam ripper) Continue ripping the seam holding the zipper to the webbing until you come to the top of the seam. (Tools used: seam ripper) When you come to the fold in the zipper webbing, insert the seam ripper between the two layers of webbing, and gently pull the stitches out. (Tools used: seam ripper) The zipper should now be free from the jacket and can be discarded. Identify where the zipper flap is still sewn into the jacket. Use the seam ripper to free the zipper flap from the jacket. The yellow rectangle in the photos above will help you identify the zipper flap. Be careful not to damage the jacket with the seam ripper as you free the webbing. (Tools used: seam ripper) Lay the jacket flat and measure from the base of the zipper to the collar, along the seam you just removed. In our case we measured 27 inches. The jacket should be flat, so you get an accurate measurement. (Tools used: seam ripper) Lay out your new zipper on a flat surface and use the measurement you recorded in the step above, starting from the zipper box, or the bottom of the zipper. Mark the measurement with tailor's chalk. Pull the zipper slider back behind the mark you just made. (Tools used: tailor s chalk) Measure one inch beyond where you just marked and make a second mark with tailor’s chalk. (Tools used: tailor s chalk) Cut the zipper between the teeth at the second mark you made. Use end nipper pliers to remove the teeth of the zipper between the two marks. Use needle-nose pliers to remove all the leftover bits of the teeth from the zipper. (Tools used: needlenose pliers, end nippers) Take a zipper stop and align it, posts down, just beyond the last remaining zipper tooth. Crimp the zipper stop onto the zipper using pliers. (Tools used: needlenose pliers) Fold the excess zipper tape away from the teeth at a slight angle. Sew the toothless end of the zipper down, backstitching to hold it in place. (Tools used: measuring tape, end nippers) Align the toothless edge of the zipper with the inside serged edge of the zipper webbing. The serged edge is the one with the zig-zag stitching. Fold the top of the webbing down over the sewn zipper tape. You can pin the zipper and webbing in place for more stability. (Tools used: measuring tape, sewing pins) Align the zipper and webbing in the sewing machine so that the zipper teeth are along the edge of the presser foot. Sew a few stitches, removing pins before you come to them. (Tools used: sewing pins, sewing machine) Sew along the edge of the zipper teeth, making sure that the zipper and webbing stay aligned. Reinsert the zipper and webbing into the jacket, aligning the edge of the jacket fabric with the zipper teeth. (Tools used: fabric scissors) While holding the zipper in place, move the fabric underneath the zipper out of the way so you’re only sewing the zipper to one layer of fabric. (Tools used: fabric scissors) Install the zipper foot into your sewing machine. Align the jacket and zipper in the sewing machine. Be sure that there is no fabric behind the zipper webbing before you sew. (Tools used: sewing machine, fabric scissors) Check your alignment and begin sewing, guiding the fabric along the zipper teeth. Go slowly, re-aligning the fabric as you go. (Tools used: fabric scissors, sewing) Continue sewing and re-aligning the zipper as you proceed along the full length of the zipper. (Tools used: sewing) When you reach the end of the zipper, backstitch to hold your stitches in place and remove the jacket from the sewing machine. (Tools used: sewing machine) Align the inside jacket fabric along the backside of the webbing. Try to align the stitch holes directly over the stitches you just sewed. (Tools used: fabric scissors) Align the jacket in the sewing machine, with the zipper webbing facing up. Holding the inside fabric of the jack in place, sew directly over the original stitching. Go slowly, re-aligning the fabric as you go. Clip the threads, and admire your work! Repeat this guide, ironing the webbing when you’re finished, to install the other side of the zipper.

Category: Patagonia Fleece Jacket. Subject: Zipper.
Tools required: seam ripper, measuring tape, utility scissors, tailor s chalk, end nippers, sewing pins, sewing machine.
Instructions: Lay your jacket face-up onto a flat surface like a table. Unzip the zipper as much as possible. Fold open the bottom corner of the jacket. [[Sewing Glossary#Section_Seam_Ripper|Rip the seam]] that holds the zipper in place. This is the outside seam of the two rows of stitching. (Tools used: seam ripper) Start ripping the inside [[Sewing Glossary#Section_Seam|seam]]. Rip only a few of the stitches. Be sure to avoid ripping the serged edge. To do this, start the blade pointing away from the serge seam. (Tools used: seam ripper, sewing) After you have ripped a few stitches, fold the jacket closed again. Pull the zipper webbing away from the teeth of the zipper. Rip the stitches holding the webbing to the zipper. At the top of the zipper there will be an area where the collar is folded back over itself. Rip out the outermost seam holding the zipper webbing in place. Both the zipper webbing and zipper should now be free from the jacket. Repeat steps 1-5 on the other side of the zipper. The second side may or may not have webbing. (Tools used: seam ripper) Lay your jacket out, holding it to full length but not stretched. Measure from the top of the collar to waist. [[Sewing Glossary#Section_Measuring_Tape|Measure]] the same length on your zipper from the zipper stop up. Mark this with tailor’s chalk. Measure two inches above that line and make a second mark with your tailor’s chalk. Cut the zipper at the first mark you made. Be sure to cut between the teeth of the zipper to preserve your scissors. Be sure that the zipper slider is below your first mark so you don't cut it off! (Tools used: tailor s chalk, utility scissors) Use end nipper pliers to cut off all of the zipper teeth above the first mark. Cut the teeth in half, and then remove the back half with your fingers. Remove two teeth below the mark on one side. Repeat this step on the other side of the zipper, removing three teeth below the mark instead of two. (Tools used: end nippers) Place the zipper stop directly above the last tooth on the zipper. Be sure you get all the way around the zipper. Crimp the zipper stop into place using pliers. Repeat this step on the second side of the zipper. Take the side of the zipper that had webbing, and fold the excess zipper  [[Sewing Glossary#Section_Bias_Tape|tape]] on the end of the zipper away from the zipper teeth at a slight angle. (Tools used: end nippers) Place the folded zipper end into the sewing machine. Tack the fold into place with a few stitches. (Tools used: sewing machine) Clip the threads on the zipper. Repeat steps 9-11 on the other side of the zipper. Take the side of the zipper that had the webbing, and lay it back into the webbing, aligning the zipper tape edge along the serged edge of the webbing. Place the top of the zipper in the crease of the fold of the webbing at the collar. (Tools used: measuring tape) Fold the top of the zipper webbing over the zipper at the crease of the collar. Pin the folded zipper webbing in place. (Tools used: sewing pins) Pin the length of the zipper to the webbing, making sure that the zipper tape edge is still aligned with the serged edge of the webbing.

Guide: Repairing Patagonia Jacket with a Shaped Baffle.
Domain hierarchy 1: Patagonia Outerwear. Domain hierarchy 2: Outerwear. Domain hierarchy 3: Clothing. Domain hierarchy 4: Apparel. Domain hierarchy 5: Root.
Category: Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket. Subject: Not specified.
Tools required: iron, sewing machine, utility scissors.
Instructions: Examine the damage on your jacket, cutting off any loose threads and freeing any debris Our garment has holes in two of the baffle segments, but we will just work on one for this guide. Choose some patch fabric. Why not choose a fun color? We did. Select thread that matches your patch fabric, and [guide|19463|load it into your sewing machine]. Select thread that matches the lining of your jacket, and [guide|19460|load it into the bobbin of your sewing machine]. Trace the shape of your baffle onto some cardstock or heavy paper. Cut out the shape of the baffle; this will be your template. Place the template over the baffle to ensure that the shape and size of your template is correct. Set your iron to the appropriate setting—in our case, nylon—and [guide|10273|iron your patch fabric] to smooth out any wrinkles. Position the template on the patch fabric, leaving about ¼ or ½ inch of extra fabric around the edges. Cut out the patch, leaving 1/4 or 1/2 inch of extra fabric around each side of the template. (Tools used: iron) Fold the edge of the fabric over, creating a fold at the edge of the template. Carefully hold the fabric in place and iron it down. (Tools used: iron) Work around the template, folding each side in, and ironing it into place. Slide the template out of the patch. Refold along the creases you previously ironed. Turn the patch over so that the right-side, or the side that will be showing, is up and press it. Align the patch with the baffle, exactly as you want it to appear when you are done. Slide the garment into the sewing machine, repositioning the patch if necessary. To prevent the insulation from leaking through the stitches, fir your sewing machine with the smallest needle available. Sink the needle to hold the patch into place. Do not pin the patch, as this will create unnecessary holes where down can escape. Holding the patch in place sew directly over the edge of your patch. (Tools used: sewing machine) When you come to the corner of your patch, sink the needle. Lift the presser foot, leaving the needle in the fabric, and gently turn the fabric 90 degrees, aligning it with the edge of the patch. Drop the presser foot and continue sewing along the second edge of the patch. Be sure to hold the patch in place as you sew. (Tools used: sewing machine) As you did with the first corner, sink the needle, lift the presser foot, and rotate the garment. Drop the presser foot and continue sewing on the third edge of the patch. (Tools used: sewing machine) Repeat step nine for the last corner, and sew the final edge of the patch in place. Backstitch when you come to the end of the patch. Lift the needle and presser foot, freeing the garment from the sewing machine. Clip any threads, and admire your work! (Tools used: sewing machine)

Category: Patagonia Nano Puff Jacket. Subject: Not specified.
Tools required: tenacious tape, utility scissors.
Instructions: Inspect the damage on your jacket. Clip any dangling threads or fabric using small scissors. (Tools used: utility scissors) Grab your repair tape. Flip the repair tape to the back side. Using a permanent marker, draw an oval slightly larger than the hole. If you have a wide hole, you can use a rectangle, but be sure to round the edges. Rounding the edges prevents the corners from getting caught and peeling up. (Tools used: tenacious tape) Cut out your shape using scissors. (Tools used: utility scissors) Using your fingernail, or a pin, peel the backing off the tenacious tape, so that you only have the clear sticky layer. Be sure not to touch the sticky side of the tape as this will gum up the tape and it won’t stick well. (Tools used: tenacious tape) Lay the tape over the hole and press the tape down with your finger. (Tools used: tenacious tape) Use a fingernail or spudger to work out all of the air bubbles under the tape. Continue rubbing the tape until it is well-adhered. (Tools used: tenacious tape)

Guide: Satin Stitch a Tear in Your Shirt.
Domain hierarchy 1: Patagonia Tops. Domain hierarchy 2: Tops. Domain hierarchy 3: Clothing. Domain hierarchy 4: Apparel. Domain hierarchy 5: Root.
Category: Patagonia Shirt. Subject: Tear.
Tools required: sewing machine, utility scissors.
Instructions: Examine the tear and the surrounding fabric. Clip any loose threads to keep them from getting caught in the new stitching. Select a coordinating color of thread and [guide|19463|thread the sewing machine]. Adjust the sewing machine to a stitch-width of two or three. Stitch-width controls the sideways distance of the stitch, so if you feel you need a little more width, three is acceptable. Every sewing machine is different, so refer to your sewing machine manual to find the stitch width adjustment on your machine. Be sure your sewing machine is fitted with a wide-mouthed pressor foot, as opposed to one with a small round hole. When the sewing machine does a satin stitch, it will bump into the the pressor foot and break if there is not a wide enough opening. (Tools used: sewing machine) Set the sewing machine stitch length down to just above zero. Stitch length controls how far forward the sewing machine advances with each stitch. Satin stitches should be very tight, which is why we want this number very close to zero. Every sewing machine is different, so refer to your sewing machine manual to find the stitch length adjustment on your machine. (Tools used: sewing machine) If the fabric you’re repairing is gauzy or thin, you can add a small scrap of interfacing or scrap fabric on the backside of your rip or tear. Most of the time this isn’t necessary. Align the fabric in the sewing machine about half an inch before the rip or tear. Lower the pressor foot and begin sewing, guiding the machine over the tear. (Tools used: sewing machine) Sew about half an inch past the end of the slit. Lift the presser foot and clip the threads to free the garment. Trim any extra threads. Admire your handiwork.

Guide: Installing a Professor Patch on a Patagonia Sweater.
Domain hierarchy 1: Patagonia Tops. Domain hierarchy 2: Tops. Domain hierarchy 3: Clothing. Domain hierarchy 4: Apparel. Domain hierarchy 5: Root.
Category: Patagonia Sweater. Subject: Professor Patch.
Tools required: ballpoint needle, measuring tape, utility scissors, sewing machine, sewing pins.
Instructions: Lay your sweater flat on a work surface, damage side up. Measure the length of the hole. Measure the width of the hole. On a piece of paper, mark the endpoints of a line that measures the length of the hole, plus one inch. Mark the center of the two endpoints. From the center, turn the measuring tape 90 degrees. Mark the endpoints of a line that measures the width of the hole, plus one inch. (Tools used: measuring tape) Sketch a curve connecting the endpoints of the length and width. Draw a straight line connecting the endpoints of the width, going though the center point. Fold the paper in half on the straight line. Cut along the curved line. The piece you have just cut out will be your pattern. Lay your pattern over the hole to verify that it is the correct size and shape. Lay your pattern over the piece of fabric you’ve choosen to use as a patch. It is important to choose a fabric that is only slightly heavier than your sweater, such as corduroy or a felted sweater. Anything heavier, such as denim or leather, may cause the sweater to tear. To felt a sweater, simply put a 100% wool sweater through the washer and dryer. When it comes out, the sweater should be shrunken and have a very tight weave. Pin your pattern piece onto your patch fabric. If you double up the patch fabric before you pin you will get two identical patches, one for each side. (Tools used: sewing pins) Using fabric scissors, cut around the pattern piece. Inspect the patch, going back to clean up any rough edges with scissors. (Tools used: utility scissors) Lay the patch over the hole, positioning it where you would like it to be. Pin the patch into place. Only pin the patch to the top layer of the sleeve fabric; if you pin and sew them both, you will sew the sleeve shut. (Tools used: sewing pins) Insert a ballpoint needle into your sewing machine. Each sewing machine is a little bit different, so check your user's manual if you aren't sure how to change your needle. (Tools used: ballpoint needle, sewing machine) Slide the sleeve over the arm of your sewing machine, just like you’d put the sleeve over your own arm. You may need to remove the table from your sewing machine to allow the sweater sleeve to slide over the sewing machine arm. Check you sewing machine manual for specific instructions on your machine. (Tools used: sewing machine) Align the very edge of the patch with the needle. Sew around the edge of the patch, turning the sleeve as you go. For a more stable patch, use zig-zag or [guide|12424|satin stitch]. Sew until you come all the way around, retracing your first stitches. (Tools used: ballpoint needle) Slide the sleeve off the arm of your sewing machine. Clip any loose threads. Repeat on the other sleeve if you want symmetrical professor patches.

Guide: Installing an Iron-on Patch.
Domain hierarchy 1: Patagonia Bottoms. Domain hierarchy 2: Bottoms. Domain hierarchy 3: Clothing. Domain hierarchy 4: Apparel. Domain hierarchy 5: Root.
Category: Patagonia Jeans. Subject: Iron-on Patch.
Tools required: fabric scissors, iron, tailor s chalk, measuring tape.
Instructions: Examine the damage – cut off any long threads and clean off any debris. Grab your iron-on patch. We are using a contrasting patch for visibility, but you may want something that matches with your jeans or a fun contrasting color. Preheat your iron according to the recommended settings found on the packaging information included with the patch. Take a scrap of denim and place it inside the pant leg, beneath the hole. This scrap material will keep your patch from sticking the front of your jeans to the back, which would effectively seal the leg opening shut (not a good thing...) (Tools used: iron) Measure the length and width of the hole in your jeans, including any damaged area around the hole. In our case the hole is about 1.5 inches by 2 inches. Add at least a half-inch in both directions to get your final patch measurements. Mark your final patch measurements on the patch with tailor’s chalk. (Tools used: tailor s chalk) Cut the patch along your marks. Round the corners of the patch, to prevent them from peeling up. Lay your cut patch over the hole and position it where you want it. Iron the patch according to the package instructions, usually from between 30-45 seconds. Keep the iron moving and try to apply even heat to the whole patch. (Tools used: iron) Run your finger around the edge of the patch to ensue that all the edges are completely bonded to your jeans. Turn the pant leg inside out. Gently try and lift the scrap of fabric from the inside of the pant leg. If the scrap comes off, you no longer need it. If the scrap is held firmly in place by the patch, simply trim away the excess fabric from where the scrap is adhered with your scissors, leaving the remaining scrap in place.

(Tools used: sewing) Flatten out the garment around the torn seam, and align the fabric where the seam used to be. Pin the two layers together. Be sure to catch only the two layers of fabric you wish to sew back together. (Tools used: sewing pins) Open the garment as much as possible, laying the seam flat. Check your alignment and make sure the two edges of your fabric line up. Put the garment in the machine, starting a few inches before the torn seam to overlap with the stitches. Drop the presser foot. Align the first line of stitches with the needle. (Tools used: sewing machine) Use the balance wheel to sink the needle into the fabric. Only turn the balance wheel in the direction that advances the machine. Turning the wheel the opposite direction can cause tangling or ruin the tension on the machine. (Tools used: sewing machine) Sew along the first line of stitches, removing the pins before you get to them. If you run over the pins, you risk breaking your needle. (Tools used: sewing pins) When you come to the end of the row of stitches, engage the backstitch function of your machine. Backstitching prevents the seam from unraveling. Backstitch functions vary widely between machines and can come in the form of buttons, levers, and knobs. See your sewing machine manual for instructions on your backstitch function. Depress the pedal slowly. Sew two or three stitches backwards. Release the pedal and disengage the backstitch function. (Tools used: sewing machine) After you've completely sewn over the torn seam, clip the threads and free the garment from the machine. (Tools used: sewing machine) Some clothes have two rows of stitching, If your garment does, reposition it in the sewing machine. Drop the needle into the second line of stitches at about where you began sewing your previous seam. Repeat steps 3-7 of this guide to resew the second line of stitches. You do not need to pin this seam, because the first seam will hold the garment in place. If your garment only has a single line of stitches, skip this step and proceed to the next step. (Tools used: sewing pins, sewing machine) Check that your stitches are straight and secure. Admire your work.

Guide: How to Iron a Waterproof Jacket.
Domain hierarchy 1: Outerwear. Domain hierarchy 2: Clothing. Domain hierarchy 3: Apparel. Domain hierarchy 4: Root.
Category: Patagonia Outerwear. Subject: Not specified.
Tools required: iron, towel.
Instructions: Unzip your clean jacket and slide one half over your ironing board. You only want to iron through one layer of the jacket. Ironing through two layers can create wrinkles in one side. Flatten your jacket with your hands. (Tools used: iron) Set your iron to its lowest setting. Ensure that the steam function of your iron is off. Steam can melt your jacket. If you can't turn off the steam function on your iron,  be sure to drain the water chamber of your iron. (Tools used: iron) Lay a towel over the area of your jacket that you'll be ironing. Smooth the towel out with your hands. (Tools used: towel) Starting near the center, iron the jacket in one smooth stroke running parallel to the zipper. Only iron in one direction. Each stroke should go in the same direction. Change directions only when you move to a new section of the jacket. Do not press down with the iron. Allow the heat and weight of the iron to do the work. Always keep the iron moving. Stopping in one place can result in burnt fabric. (Tools used: iron) Remove the towel from your jacket. Inspect your work. If it looks as though the iron did nothing, you can increase the heat of your iron by one setting and try ironing again. If your work looks good, position another section of the jacket flat on the ironing board, re-cover it with the towel and repeat the process until your whole jacket is wrinkle-free. Don't forget to turn off the iron when you finish. (Tools used: towel, iron)

Guide: How to Darn a Hole in a Knitted Garment.
Domain hierarchy 1: Patagonia Tops. Domain hierarchy 2: Tops. Domain hierarchy 3: Clothing. Domain hierarchy 4: Apparel. Domain hierarchy 5: Root.
Category: Patagonia Sweater. Subject: Not specified.
Tools required: needle, thread.
Instructions: Inspect the damage. Clean any dirt or debris from the area. Tie off any loose threads from the hole. (Tools used: thread) Cut a length of thread. We're using contrasting thread in our guide so that you can see it. However, when it comes time for your repair, you'll want to use thread that matches the color of your garment's fabric so that your stitching is less visible. (Tools used: thread) Insert one end of the thread through the eye of the needle. (Tools used: needle) Align the two ends of the thread. Your needle should be threaded between these two ends. Tie the ends off in an overhand knot. Tie a second overhand knot to make the knot in the thread larger. (Tools used: thread, needle) Starting about a centimeter to the side of the hole, and half a centimeter below, insert the needle from the back of the garment. You should only push the needle through one layer of the garment as you work. If you go through both layers, you will sew the garment shut. (Tools used: needle) Pull the needle through to the front of the garment until the thread is taut and the knot catches in the back. Take a single [guide|21032|straight stitch] going into a single layer of fabric and coming back up one row of the knit closer to the hole. (Tools used: needle) Pull the needle through until the thread is taut, but not scrunching or gathering the fabric. (Tools used: needle) Take another straight stitch towards the hole, going in and out of a single layer of the garment, passing the thread under a single row of the knit. Try to work perpendicular to the grain of the knit, creating a straight row of stitches. Pull the needle through until the thread is taut, but not pulling or scrunching the fabric. (Tools used: thread, needle) Continue working across the hole taking stitches under every other row of the knit. This photo illustrates how the needle should go under every other row of stitches. If you are new to sewing, it is better to take one stitch at a time. When you get about a centimeter past the hole, pull the needle through until the thread is taut, but not gathering or scrunching the fabric. (Tools used: needle) Turn the needle around and take a stitch going the opposite direction (towards where you started) just above your last row of stitches. (Tools used: needle) Pull the thread through until it is taut. You should see the thread loop around to go the other direction. (Tools used: thread) Stitch this second row the same way you did the first, but in the opposite direction. This time, go under the rows of knit you previously went over, and vice versa. When you reach the end of this second row, turn around and continue stitching in the previous direction. Stitch rows back and forth until you have worked about a centimeter past the hole. Don't forget to pull the thread taut after each stitch. If you are new to sewing, take your time, slowly completing each stitch. (Tools used: thread) When you have finished sewing rows, take the needle and insert it across the top corner of your stitching at a forty-five degree angle, taking a stitch. As you begin to pull the needle through you will see a loop form. Catch the loop with your finger. Do not pull the thread taut yet. (Tools used: thread, needle) Insert the needle into the loop. Pull the needle through the loop. (Tools used: needle) Pull the thread taut, closing the loop and creating a knot. (Tools used: thread) Insert the needle at a forty-five degree angle to your previous stitching, taking the needle under one row of the knit. You will begin to stitch over your previous stitches at a forty-five degree angle, just as before. Remember to only stitch through one layer of the garment. (Tools used: needle) Pull the needle through until the thread is taut. (Tools used: needle) Take another stitch crossing your previous stitching at forty-five degrees. Pull the needle through until the thread is taut. Continue stitching in this manner until you come to the edge of your previous rows of stitching. (Tools used: needle) When you come to the edge of your stitches, turn the needle around and begin stitching another line of stitches at a forty-five degree angle alongside the line you just made. (Tools used: needle) Continue stitching, alternating under and over the rows of knit. Don't forget to pull the thread taut after each stitch. (Tools used: thread) When you have covered all your rows of stitching with lines of stitching at forty-five degrees, check your work to make sure that the fabric is not pulling or gathered anywhere. If you have a pull or gather, you can flatten it with your finger, allowing the thread to loosen. (Tools used: thread) Drive the needle into the bottom corner of your stitching. Pull the needle through to the backside (inside) of the garment. (Tools used: needle) On the backside, take a small stitch very close to where the needle came through. Slowly pull the needle through the fabric, creating a loop. Catch the loop in your fingers. Put the needle through the loop. (Tools used: needle) Pull the needle through the loop, creating a knot. Pull the thread taut, tightening the knot. (Tools used: thread, needle) Drive the needle under the knot you just created, catching a small bit of the garment in the stitch. Slowly pull the needle through, creating another loop. Put the needle through the loop. (Tools used: needle) Pull the needle through the loop creating a knot. Pull the thread taut, creating a knot on top of the knot you previously made. (Tools used: thread, needle) Clip the dangling threads and admire your handiwork. This image illustrates how the darning will look when you use matching thread. (Tools used: thread)

Category: Patagonia Down Jacket. Subject: Not specified.
Tools required: tennis balls, down wash.
Instructions: Lay your jacket out and zip up all the zippers. If your jacket has hook-and-loop tape, fasten it closed. Don't forget to check the pockets for any treasures or love notes you may have forgotten. Place the jacket in your washing machine. Add technical wash specifically designed for down garments. Each brand of technical wash is different, so you'll need to read the label on your bottle to know how much to add. (Tools used: down wash) Set the load size on the washing machine to small. Set the water temperature on the washing machine to cold/cold. Run the washing machine on a gentle or normal wash cycle. (Tools used: down wash) Leave the jacket in the washing machine and run the rinse cycle a second time. Remove the jacket from the washing machine and place it in the dryer. If you don't have a dryer, or would like to go a more environmentally friendly route, [guide|27465|line dry your jacket]. Add a couple of tennis balls to the dryer. The tennis balls will bounce around as the dryer tumbles, preventing the down from clumping. (Tools used: tennis balls) Set the dryer on a low-heat setting with a normal dry-cycle time. Start the dryer. It may take more than one cycle on the dryer to completely dry your jacket. If so, leave the heat on low and dry for a second cycle.

Guide: Repair a Hole in Patagonia Waders.
Domain hierarchy 1: Patagonia Outerwear. Domain hierarchy 2: Outerwear. Domain hierarchy 3: Clothing. Domain hierarchy 4: Apparel. Domain hierarchy 5: Root.
Category: Patagonia Waders. Subject: Not specified.
Tools required: garden hose, patagonia wader repair kit, ladder, paintbrush, sharpie.
Instructions: Set up a ladder in a level place outside that you don't mind getting wet. Turn the waders inside out. Clip the waders to the ladder. (Tools used: patagonia wader repair kit, ladder) Put the hose into the waders. Slide the hose into one leg of the waders. (Tools used: garden hose) Turn on the hose and begin to fill the waders. Be sure to pay attention because the large amount of water may tip the ladder. If needed, weigh the back side of the ladder down to prevent it from tipping. (Tools used: garden hose, ladder) Watch for leaks. When you find a leak, mark it with a permanent marker. Repeat this process for the other leg, marking all the leaks you find. Dump the water out and allow the waders to dry completely before you continue. (Tools used: patagonia wader repair kit) Wipe your marked areas down with an alcohol wipe to clean them. Wait for the area to completely dry before continuing. Add a drop of Seam Grip to the marked area. You need enough Seam Grip to thinly cover a one-inch square. Use the paintbrush to spread the Seam Grip thinly and evenly over the area. (Tools used: paintbrush) Rotate your brush 90 degrees and spread the glue evenly over the area. Apply the thin film (included in your wader repair kit) on top of the Seam Grip. Smooth out the film with your finger, pushing out any air bubbles. Allow the waders to sit undisturbed for 12 hours. (Tools used: patagonia wader repair kit) Peel the thin film off of the waders. (Tools used: patagonia wader repair kit)

Tools required: ph0 phillips screwdriver, spudger.
Instructions: You will need: CR 2032 Battery Philips #0 screwdriver Something to pop the battery out, like a thin spudger, or a #2 slot screwdriver. (Tools used: ph0 phillips screwdriver, spudger) Remove these four screws. They're all the same size. Lift off the case back. Underneath, you'll see a sheet of plastic film. It should be possible to remove the battery without removing the film, if you're careful, but I didn't want to risk bending or tearing the plastic. If you do take the plastic off, beware of maneuvering it over the three springs in the upper left, and the small prong that sticks out over the battery. You'll need to be sure to arrange the plastic carefully over these obstructions when re-assembling. Insert spudger or flat screwdriver in the notch indicated by the arrow, and lever out the battery. The new battery should insert the same way the old one came out, and snap into place. (Tools used: spudger)

Guide: How to Prevent a Run or Tear in Tights from Spreading.
Domain hierarchy 1: Apparel. Domain hierarchy 2: Root.
Category: Clothing. Subject: Run or Tear in Tights.
Tools required: clear nail polish, utility scissors.
Instructions: Put the ripped tights on for easier repair, or leave them on if you’re already wearing them. Gather clear nail polish and a pair of scissors. (Tools used: clear nail polish) Locate all potential runs or directions that the rip can expand. Runs will not usually expand horizontally, but be sure to check both vertical ends of the run. Gently tug the tights away from your skin to prevent the nail polish from affixing to your body. (Tools used: clear nail polish) Brush a dollop of clear nail polish on all potential runs. Small runs will require just a dab of nail polish while larger holes may require a thin coat. Repeat these steps to all potential runs and loose threads. (Tools used: clear nail polish) Once the nail polish has dried, you may cut any hanging pieces of thread. The nail polish will take about 1 minute to dry. Be sure to complete this step after applying the nail polish and letting it dry or a new run will form. (Tools used: clear nail polish)

Guide: How to Hand Sew a Tear in Clothing.
Domain hierarchy 1: Apparel. Domain hierarchy 2: Root.
Category: Clothing. Subject: Not specified.
Tools required: sewing needle, thread, utility scissors.
Instructions: Lay out your piece of clothing with the tear facing up and in sight on a flat surface. A table is a good place for a work surface rather than your lap or the ground. Cut a long piece of thread with the scissors. Cut the length of the thread according to how long the tear is. For a 5 inch tear, cut about a 1.5 foot piece of thread. If you have excess thread at the end of the task, you can always cut the extra off. You cannot do so if you do not have enough thread to finish sewing. Choose thread that matches the color of the material so that the thread blends in with the material, hiding the tear. (Tools used: thread) Tie a knot at one end of the thread. (Tools used: thread) Put the un-knotted end of the thread through the eye of the needle (the hole in the needle). This step can be frustrating, but be patient. To make it easier, wet the end you are putting through the hole and flatten the thread with your fingers. Now try again. Be careful while using the needle. It is pointy and sharp. (Tools used: sewing needle, thread) To begin stitching: Take the threaded needle in your fingers and place under one end of the tear with the needle pointing up. Poke the needle through the left side of the tear and pull on the needle upward until the knot reaches the material and stops the thread from going any further upward. (Tools used: sewing needle) Turn the needle downward on the right side of the tear, poke a hole making the needle go through the hole with the thread following. Poke hole on the underside of the left side of the tear. Pull the needle slowly until the knot won't allow you to pull anymore. (Tools used: sewing needle) Continue to stitch until the needle reaches the other end of the tear, making sure that the stitches are close enough together that the material from one end of the tear and the other end are sewn tightly together with little to no gaps. (Tools used: sewing needle) When you get to the end of the tear, prepare to make a knot. Make a small stitch but this time pull the needle upward through the loop formed and pull up until the loop closes. Do at least twice. (Tools used: sewing needle) Cut the leftover thread off with the scissors so you are left with about an inch of thread dangling after the knot. (Tools used: thread) Your tear is now sewn together!

Guide: How To Re-String A Hoodie.
Domain hierarchy 1: Clothing. Domain hierarchy 2: Apparel. Domain hierarchy 3: Root.
Category: Tops. Subject: Not specified.
Tools required: masking tape, wire coat hanger.
Instructions: Uncoil the wire coat hanger into a straight line. (Tools used: wire coat hanger) Tape the end of the uncoiled coat hanger to one end of your sweatshirt string. Make sure the clothes hanger is securely taped to ensure that the string doesn't detach during the re-stringing process. When taping, make sure no adhesive is felt over the outside of the apparatus. This will make the re-stringing process easier because the tape won't be sticking to the sweatshirt. (Tools used: wire coat hanger, masking tape) Insert the wire and string apparatus into the left opening of the hoodie. (Tools used: wire coat hanger) Feed the wire through the hoodie until it reaches the top of the hood. (Tools used: wire coat hanger) Curve the wire to the right so that the wire can follow the curve of the hood. (Tools used: wire coat hanger) Continue feeding the wire through the hood towards the other opening of the hoodie. Pull the wire and string out of the opening. (Tools used: wire coat hanger) Remove the tape from the end of the wire and string. (Tools used: masking tape) Remove the wire from the hoodie by pushing the left end of the wire through the hoodie, while pulling the right end out. (Tools used: wire coat hanger) Tie each end of the string in a knot to prevent the string from coming out of the hoodie.

Guide: Apple Watch Battery Replacement.
Domain hierarchy 1: Apple Smartwatch. Domain hierarchy 2: Smartwatch. Domain hierarchy 3: Apparel. Domain hierarchy 4: Root.
Category: Apple Watch. Subject: Battery.
Tools required: iopener, opening tool, opening tool, curved razor blade, tweezers.
Instructions: We recommend that you clean your microwave before proceeding, as any nasty gunk on the bottom may end up stuck to the iOpener. Place the iOpener in the center of the microwave. For carousel microwaves: Make sure the plate spins freely. If your iOpener gets stuck, it may overheat and burn. (Tools used: iopener) Heat the iOpener for '''thirty seconds'''. Throughout the repair procedure, as the iOpener cools, reheat it in the microwave for an additional thirty seconds at a time. Be careful not to overheat the iOpener during the repair. Overheating may cause the iOpener to burst. Never touch the iOpener if it appears swollen. If the iOpener is still too hot in the middle to touch, continue using it while waiting for it to cool down some more before reheating. A properly heated iOpener should stay warm for up to 10 minutes. (Tools used: iopener) Remove the iOpener from the microwave, holding it by one of the two flat ends to avoid the hot center. The iOpener will be very hot, so be careful when handling it. Use an oven mitt if necessary. (Tools used: iopener) Place the heated iOpener on the face of the watch. Leave the iOpener on the watch for at least a minute to heat the screen and soften the adhesive holding it to the case. You may need to reheat the iOpener, or move it around on the screen as sections cool, to heat the screen enough to pry it off. (Tools used: iopener) Because the gap between the screen and watch body is so thin, a sharp blade is required to separate the two. '''Read the following warnings carefully before proceeding.''' Always '''keep your fingers completely clear''' of the knife. Be careful '''not to apply too much pressure,''' as this might cause the knife to slip and cut you, or damage the watch. '''Wear eye protection.''' The knife or glass may break, sending pieces flying. (Tools used: curved razor blade) Using a curved blade minimizes the chance of scratching the case or cracking the glass. Only pry with the curved section of the blade, and not the tip or flat section. Place the curved section of the blade in the gap between the glass and case on the lower edge of the watch face, and press firmly down into the gap. Be very careful to maintain complete control over the knife—once the gap opens, if you're pressing too hard on the knife it may slip in and cut the battery. This should wedge the gap open and cause the glass to lift slightly up from the case. When the glass has lifted, gently rotate the knife down, opening the gap more by pushing the glass up. (Tools used: curved razor blade, opening tool) Once you've opened the gap enough, insert the tip of an opening pick under the glass. Slide the pick along the bottom edge to separate adhesive holding the screen to the case. Be careful not to insert the opening pick too far. Only about 1/8" ( about 3 mm) is necessary, any deeper and you may damage cables. (Tools used: opening tool) Roll the opening pick up the side of the button side of the watch, gently pushing in to separate the adhesive and widening the gap as you go. Remember not to push the pick in too far—it's easier to avoid this by rolling the pick, rather than dragging a tip along. (Tools used: opening tool) Work the pick around the top right corner, and roll it along the top edge of the screen. Continue working the pick around the perimeter of the screen, rolling down along the left side to cut the last of the adhesive. Leave the pick in place to keep the adhesive from resealing the screen in place. While holding the first pick in place, use a second to check that all of the adhesive is separated around the entire perimeter of the screen. There are two cables connecting the screen to the inside of the watch, near the top left corner. Be careful when prying or you may damage these cables. Pry slightly up on the right side of the screen, to free it from any remaining adhesive. Pry up on the left to free it as well—but '''do not attempt to remove the screen''' as it is still held in place by two cables. If you can see the top layer of your Force Touch sensor among the display adhesive, it means the two layers of the sensor separated and you're going to need to replace or repair it. The top layer of the sensor may be adhered to the back of the screen—push it down to separate it, and '''switch to our [guide|41084|Force Touch Sensor guide] from this point on.''' Lift the screen up and shift it to the left, minding the display data and digitizer cables. Place the watch on an elevated surface, at least 1/2" or 1 cm tall—a small box or the edge of a book will work great. This will allow the screen to hang down vertically and give better access to the battery. Be careful not to bump the screen or strain the cables while you work. Wedge a plastic opening tool between the right side of the battery and the case. Pry the battery up to separate it from the adhesive securing it to the system board. '''Do not''' attempt to remove the battery as it is still connected. (Tools used: opening tool) Rotate the battery counterclockwise to expose its connector. Hold the battery up and out of the way, to expose the battery cable connector. Use a plastic opening tool, prying against the bottom of the case to separate the battery cable connector from the watch's battery cable. Remove the battery from the watch. (Tools used: opening tool)

Hold the battery up and out of the way, to expose the battery cable connector. Use a plastic opening tool, prying against the bottom of the case to separate the battery cable connector from the watch's battery cable. Remove the battery from the watch. (Tools used: opening tool) Fold the screen up and over to the right, to expose the cables underneath. The display and digitizer cable connectors are secured beneath a small metal bracket that is adhered to the speaker. Use a plastic opening tool to flip the bracket toward the display and up from the speaker. If you simply pry toward the watch band you may tear the cables. (Tools used: opening tool) The bracket that contains the display and digitizer cable connections is made up of an upper and lower piece. The connectors are secured to the lower, and the upper must be removed to disconnect them. Use fine-tipped tweezers to grasp the lower half of the bracket. There is a small metal tab that protrudes downward from the upper metal bracket. Insert a small (1 mm) flathead screwdriver between the tab and the lower bracket, and rotate the screwdriver to spread the gap. This will release two tabs that hold the upper bracket to the lower, and should free the upper bracket. (Tools used: tweezers, flathead screwdriver) The upper half of the display connector bracket is held at the upper end by a metal tab that fits into a slot in the lower bracket. Grab the upper bracket with your tweezers and slide it toward the top of the watch to disengage this tab and free the bracket. (Tools used: tweezers) Disconnect the display data and digitizer cables. Be careful not to touch any of the contacts directly, as your finger oils may impede connectivity. Remove the display.

Guide: Apple Watch Adhesive Replacement.
Domain hierarchy 1: Apple Smartwatch. Domain hierarchy 2: Smartwatch. Domain hierarchy 3: Apparel. Domain hierarchy 4: Root.
Category: Apple Watch. Subject: Adhesive.
Tools required: tweezers, opening tool.
Instructions: Use a plastic opening tool to scrape adhesive off the back of the screen. (Tools used: opening tool) You may be able to peel up the adhesive with tweezers. Once you have all of the pieces of adhesive removed, you may want to use an alcohol soaked q-tip to clean any residue off the back of the screen. (Tools used: tweezers) Use tweezers to peel the outer ring off of one of the adhesive strip pads. Be sure to get both the double-sided adhesive and the brown backing paper. Be very careful not to fold, bend, or stretch the adhesive tape, as this will make it too thick to seal the screen without a ridge between the screen and the case. (Tools used: tweezers) Lay the backed adhesive tape down on the Force Touch sensor, around the edge of the case where the screen rests. Start in a corner with the tape as close to the corner wall as possible. Press on the brown backing paper with a plastic opening tool to secure the adhesive around the entire perimeter. (Tools used: opening tool) Use a plastic opening tool to reconnect the display data and digitizer cable connectors. Be careful not to touch any of the contacts directly, as your finger oils may impede connectivity. (Tools used: opening tool) To reinstall the metal bracket, line up the single tab with the slot in the top of the lower half, and slide the bracket down. Snap the upper bracket in place. Line the battery connector up with its mate on the cable inside the watch body. Use tweezers to press the two connectors together. (Tools used: tweezers) Rotate the battery down into its slot, and press it into position. Press the battery down against the S1 to re-adhere it in place. Now is the best time to test powering on your watch—if it doesn't turn on, double check all three connectors and try again. Use tweezers to peel off the adhesive backing strip. (Tools used: tweezers) Move the screen back to the right, folding the display data and digitizer cables neatly. Center the screen over the case and press it down firmly onto the adhesive.

The iOpener will be very hot, so be careful when handling it. Use an oven mitt if necessary. (Tools used: iopener) Place the heated iOpener on the face of the watch. Leave the iOpener on the watch for at least a minute to heat the screen and soften the adhesive holding it to the case. You may need to reheat the iOpener, or move it around on the screen as sections cool, to heat the screen enough to pry it off. (Tools used: iopener) Because the gap between the screen and watch body is so thin, a sharp blade is required to separate the two. '''Read the following warnings carefully before proceeding.''' Always '''keep your fingers completely clear''' of the knife. Be careful '''not to apply too much pressure,''' as this might cause the knife to slip and cut you, or damage the watch. '''Wear eye protection.''' The knife or glass may break, sending pieces flying. (Tools used: apple watch driver bit) Using a curved blade minimizes the chance of scratching the case or cracking the glass. Only pry with the curved section of the blade, and not the tip or flat section. Place the curved section of the blade in the gap between the glass and case on the lower edge of the watch face, and press firmly down into the gap. Be very careful to maintain complete control over the knife—once the gap opens, if you're pressing too hard on the knife it may slip in and cut the battery. This should wedge the gap open and cause the glass to lift slightly up from the case. When the glass has lifted, gently rotate the knife down, opening the gap more by pushing the glass up. (Tools used: curved razor blade, opening tool) Once you've opened the gap enough, insert the tip of an opening pick under the glass. Slide the pick along the bottom edge to separate adhesive holding the screen to the case. Be careful not to insert the opening pick too far. Only about 1/8" ( about 3 mm) is necessary, any deeper and you may damage cables. (Tools used: opening tool) Roll the opening pick up the side of the button side of the watch, gently pushing in to separate the adhesive and widening the gap as you go. Remember not to push the pick in too far—it's easier to avoid this by rolling the pick, rather than dragging a tip along. (Tools used: opening tool) Work the pick around the top right corner, and roll it along the top edge of the screen. Continue working the pick around the perimeter of the screen, rolling down along the left side to cut the last of the adhesive. Leave the pick in place to keep the adhesive from resealing the screen in place. While holding the first pick in place, use a second to check that all of the adhesive is separated around the entire perimeter of the screen. There are two cables connecting the screen to the inside of the watch, near the top left corner. Be careful when prying or you may damage these cables. Pry slightly up on the right side of the screen, to free it from any remaining adhesive. Pry up on the left to free it as well—but '''do not attempt to remove the screen''' as it is still held in place by two cables. (Tools used: apple watch driver bit) If you can see the top layer of your Force Touch sensor among the display adhesive, it means the two layers of the sensor separated and you're going to need to replace or repair it. The top layer of the sensor may be adhered to the back of the screen—push it down to separate it, and '''switch to our [guide|41084|Force Touch Sensor guide] from this point on.''' Lift the screen up and shift it to the left, minding the display data and digitizer cables. Place the watch on an elevated surface, at least 1/2" or 1 cm tall—a small box or the edge of a book will work great. This will allow the screen to hang down vertically and give better access to the battery. Be careful not to bump the screen or strain the cables while you work. (Tools used: apple watch driver bit) Wedge a plastic opening tool between the right side of the battery and the case. Pry the battery up to separate it from the adhesive securing it to the system board. '''Do not''' attempt to remove the battery as it is still connected. (Tools used: opening tool) Rotate the battery counterclockwise to expose its connector. Hold the battery up and out of the way, to expose the battery cable connector. Use a plastic opening tool, prying against the bottom of the case to separate the battery cable connector from the watch's battery cable. Remove the battery from the watch. (Tools used: apple watch driver bit, opening tool) Fold the screen up and over to the right, to expose the cables underneath. The display and digitizer cable connectors are secured beneath a small metal bracket that is adhered to the speaker. Use a plastic opening tool to flip the bracket toward the display and up from the speaker. If you simply pry toward the watch band you may tear the cables. (Tools used: apple watch driver bit, opening tool) The bracket that contains the display and digitizer cable connections is made up of an upper and lower piece. The connectors are secured to the lower, and the upper must be removed to disconnect them. Use fine-tipped tweezers to grasp the lower half of the bracket. There is a small metal tab that protrudes downward from the upper metal bracket. Insert a small (1 mm) flathead screwdriver between the tab and the lower bracket, and rotate the screwdriver to spread the gap. This will release two tabs that hold the upper bracket to the lower, and should free the upper bracket. (Tools used: tweezers) The upper half of the display connector bracket is held at the upper end by a metal tab that fits into a slot in the lower bracket. Grab the upper bracket with your tweezers and slide it toward the top of the watch to disengage this tab and free the bracket. (Tools used: tweezers) Disconnect the display data and digitizer cables. Be careful not to touch any of the contacts directly, as your finger oils may impede connectivity. Remove the display. Remove the single triwing screw securing the Force Touch sensor connector cable. https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Tools/Tri-point-Y000-Screwdriver-for-Apple-Watch-and-iPhone-7/IF145-309 This screw is very small and strips easily, take care to operate at a proper angle and push as you turn. Use a plastic opening tool to flip the Force Touch sensor cable connector straight down, disconnecting it. (Tools used: opening tool) Microwave your iOpener for another 30 seconds, and apply it to the front of the watch case to soften the adhesive securing the Force Touch sensor. (Tools used: iopener) Use a plastic opening pick and tweezers to remove the Force Touch sensor from the case. (Tools used: opening tool) Use tweezers to peel up any adhesive left behind on the lower case. Also remove any adhesive that stuck to the Force Touch sensor. You may want to use an alcohol-soaked q-tip to clean any residue off the case. Be sure to let it dry before proceeding. (Tools used: tweezers) Use tweezers to peel the outer ring off of one of the adhesive strip pads. Be sure to get both the double-sided adhesive and the brown backing paper. Be very careful not to fold, bend, or stretch the adhesive tape, as this will make it too thick to seal the screen without a ridge between the screen and the case. (Tools used: tweezers) Lay the backed adhesive tape down on the case, around the edge where the screen rests. Start in a corner with the tape as close to the corner wall as possible. Press on the brown backing paper with a plastic opening tool to secure the adhesive around the entire perimeter. (Tools used: opening tool) The following steps detail repairing a Force Touch sensor with separated layers. If you're replacing your Force Touch sensor with a new part, ignore these steps. The remaining adhesive sticker backing makes a great work surface. Open the gap between the two layers, but do not peel apart any more of the original adhesive. Apply super-glue to the lower half of the sensor and press the upper half down into the glue. Press hard to squeeze out any excess glue and make the sensor as thin as possible. Before the sensor gets glued to the paper, lift it up and let it complete its drying in the air. You will likely have a few small extrusions of glue—once they've dried, you can break these off with tweezers. (Tools used: tweezers) Peel the backing off of the adhesive you applied earlier. Set the Force Touch sensor on top of the adhesive, back in the case. Be sure to properly orient it, with the connector in the lower left corner, facing up. Use a plastic opening tool to press it against the adhesive and make a tight seal. (Tools used: opening tool) Use tweezers to fold the Force Touch sensor cable connector back up onto its socket. Then use a plastic opening tool to press the cable connector into the socket. (Tools used: tweezers, opening tool) Replace the triwing screw securing the Force Touch sensor connector cable.

Guide: How to Hem Jeans.
Domain hierarchy 1: Bottoms. Domain hierarchy 2: Clothing. Domain hierarchy 3: Apparel. Domain hierarchy 4: Root.
Category: Jeans. Subject: Not specified.
Tools required: sewing machine, heavy duty denim sewing machine needle, tailor s chalk, seam gauge, sewing pins, safety pin.
Instructions: While wearing your jeans, have a friend help you fold the cuffs of each pant leg to your desired length. Have your friend safety pin the folded cuff to the pant leg to hold the fold in place. Be careful that your friend only catches the fabric and doesn't stab you with a pin in the process. Using safety pins as opposed to straight pins allows you to change out of the jeans without getting stabbed by a pin. You only need to do one pant leg, as you will measure to make them even. If you have legs that are slightly different lengths, you can do this on both sides. (Tools used: safety pin, sewing pins) Measure the length from the cuff of the jeans to the fold. This is the length you want to remove from the jeans. Unpin the cuff of the jeans. Unfold the cuff of the jeans and turn them so that the hem faces you. Use the measurement from [https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/How+to+Hem+Jeans/44388#s99463|Step 2] to measure from the cuff of the jean and make a mark with tailor's chalk. Move over a few inches and measure from the cuff again, making a second mark in line with the first. Continue marking your measurement all the way around the pant leg. (Tools used: tailor s chalk) Add an inch to the measurement you took, and use tailor's chalk to mark this new measurement as a second line one inch above the first line you made. We need to double the hem length, so we'll be adding one inch to our measurement since a standard jean hem is half an inch. If you have a different size hem, simply add double the hem length to your measurement. Continue marking all the way around the pant leg. (Tools used: tailor s chalk) Insert a row of straight pins along the marks of  your second line, which sits one inch above the amount you want to remove. Be sure to only catch one layer of the jeans, as you don't want to pin the pant leg shut! The pins should lay along the length of the line, not perpendicular to it. Insert pins all the way around the pant leg. (Tools used: sewing pins) Fold the cuff of the pant leg up to meet the line of pins, matching the edge of the jeans with the row of pins. Insert a row of pins perpendicular to the bottom of the cuff, catching the fold and holding it in place. Be careful not to pin the pant leg shut. You only need to pin the cuff to a single layer of the pant leg. Insert pins all the way around the pant leg. Remove the first horizontal row of pins. (Tools used: sewing pins) [https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Thread+a+Sewing+Machine/19463|Set up your sewing machine|new_window=true] with thread that matches your jeans and a heavy-duty/denim needle. Insert the pant leg into the sewing machine, sliding the cuff around the arm of the sewing machine. You may want to remove the table on your sewing machine to make it easier to get around the arm. Make sure the pant leg is around the arm of the sewing machine so that you don't sew the pant leg shut. There should only be the two layers of the fold between the presser foot and the sewing machine arm. (Tools used: sewing machine) Align the center of the presser foot (and needle) with the edge of the hem on the jeans. This is where the dark bottom edge of the jeans meets the light inside color of the jeans. Lower the presser foot and take a few stitches, keep the line of stitches right at the edge of the hem. (Tools used: heavy duty denim sewing machine needle) When you come to the first pin, stop sewing. Without lifting the presser foot, remove the pin. Never sew over pins. If the needle of the sewing machine hits a pin it can bend or break. Continue sewing around the pant leg, at the edge of the hem, stopping to remove pins as you go. (Tools used: sewing machine, sewing pins) When you come back to where you started sewing, continue sewing, overlapping the first few stitches. In this photo we've sewn slightly off of the edge of the hem for visibility. When you sew your jeans, you will want to sew as close to that edge as possible. (Tools used: sewing machine) Lift the presser foot and slide the jeans out. Clip the threads that attach the jeans to the sewing machine. (Tools used: sewing machine) Unfold the jeans, tucking the fold you just sewed inside the pant leg. Insert the pant leg back into the sewing machine, right-side out, around the arm of the machine. Make sure the pant leg is around the arm of the sewing machine, so that you don't sew the pant leg shut. There should only be the two layers of the fold between the presser foot and the sewing machine arm. Align the presser foot along the edge of the side seam of the pants. (Tools used: seam gauge, sewing machine) Lower the presser foot and take a couple of stitches. Use the reverse function on your sewing machine to backstitch a couple of stitches. (Tools used: sewing machine) Sew along the edge of the hem for about a dozen stitches. Use the reverse function on your sewing machine to backstitch a couple of stitches. (Tools used: sewing machine) Remove the pant leg from the sewing machine and clip any threads. Repeat [https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/How+to+Hem+Jeans/44388#s99479|Steps 13]-16 of this guide, sewing the side seam on the other side of the pants. You can trim the excess fabric of the fold on the inside of the pants if you want, or you can leave it folded inside the jeans. If you leave it, you can always [https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/How+to+Rip+a+Seam/19500| remove the stitching|new_window=true] to restore the original length to the jeans, which can be useful for growing kids.

Guide: Samsung Gear 2 Neo  Battery Replacement.
Domain hierarchy 1: Samsung Smartwatch. Domain hierarchy 2: Smartwatch. Domain hierarchy 3: Apparel. Domain hierarchy 4: Root.
Category: Samsung Gear 2 Neo. Subject: Battery.
Tools required: spudger, t5 torx screwdriver.
Instructions: To remove the Gear 2 Neo's watch band, start by locating the small metal levers on either end of the band. Using your finger, push downward on the lever to release the band locking mechanism. Note: If you have especially short fingernails, it may be easier to use a Spudger to depress the levers. Continue to hold the lever down and pull the end of the band away from the watch to completely detach it. Repeat this process for the other side of the band to fully release it. (Tools used: spudger) Start by removing the four Torx T5 Security Screws from the back panel of the Watch Assembly. (Tools used: t5 torx screwdriver) Once the four Torx screws have been removed from the Watch Assembly, using a spudger, gently pry the front and back halves of the watch away from each other. This is best accomplished by placing the head of the spudger in the space between the two halves and  rotating the head until the two halves split apart. Be careful not to let the spudger slip into the casing too far; doing so could damage the internal components. Once the two halves have separated simply lift the back half up and away from the front half to complete this step. There are no cables connecting the front and back halves of the watch together; there is no need to worry about pulling any cables or connectors out in this step. (Tools used: spudger) Once separated, the back half of the device is easily distinguished from the front by the large white battery. Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the important components presented in this half of the device before continuing. 300 mAh Battery Battery Connector (attached by way of adhesive) Device Speaker. Be aware that the orange lining around the edge of the device forms part of the seal that prevents moisture from entering the main assembly. Be careful to not disturb this lining or the Gear 2 Neo will become dramatically less water resistant. To remove the battery, simply use the provided tab labeled "pull" to separate the battery from the casing. Do not pull the battery all the way out quite yet; there is still the matter of detaching the battery connector. There is a small application of adhesive on the underside of the battery. When lifting the battery away, if you feel a bit of resistance, feel free to press down on the casing to give yourself a bit of leverage. Caution: Be very careful not to puncture the battery in this step or while recycling; doing so can result in the release of dangerous gases and an explosive reaction. Finally, using a spudger, separate the end of the battery connector cable, (held in place by another small application of adhesive and a plastic pin) from the casing. (Tools used: spudger) Installing the new battery is as easy as setting the new battery in the indent made for it and re-seating the connector around the pin. With this done, the repair is complete! Be sure to recycle the old rechargeable battery in a safe manner. Please check nearby for recycling centers and drop-offs for electronic waste.

There are no cables connecting the front and back halves of the watch together; there is no need to worry about pulling any cables or connectors out in this step. (Tools used: spudger) Once separated, the front half of the device is easily distinguished from the back by the blue mainboard. Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the important components presented in this half of the device before continuing. AMOLED display connector Heart Rate Sensor Front button assembly Infrared Blaster Be aware that the small red rings seated on the four screw mounting points form part of the seal that prevents moisture from entering the main assembly. Be careful to replace these if they fall off during the repair process or the Gear 2 Neo will become dramatically less water resistant. Using a pair of precision tweezers, gently grip and disconnect the AMOLED display connector from the mainboard. (Tools used: precision tweezers) The mainboard is secured in place by a shaped snap-fit plastic bracket. Simply  apply pressure under the mainboard using a spudger to free it. Once the mainboard is released from the bracket, use a pair of precision tweezers to remove the mainboard completely. The mainboard is an ESD sensitive device and should be handled with care to avoid static discharge. It is recommend you use an anti-static wrist strap when handling this component. (Tools used: precision tweezers, spudger, anti-static wrist strap) The AMOLED display is secured to the front watch assembly with adhesive in two different ways; one being an adhesive ring around the edge, and two being a small adhesive application between the display and front watch assembly. In order to free the display, use a spudger to gently apply pressure to the back of the AMOLED panel until the top half the the display separates from the front panel. Do not attempt to force the display all the way off of the front assembly in this step. Doing so will likely flex the AMOLED display enough to shatter it. The adhesive application on the backside of the display must first be removed. Once the top half of the display has been separated from the front panel, use a spudger to clear the adhesive from the underside of the display. When the underside of the display has been cleared of adhesive, continue to apply pressure with the spudger until the display comes free of the front watch assembly. Be sure to leave the adhesive ring in place once the display has been removed; it is critical for installing the new AMOLED display. (Tools used: spudger) With the AMOLED display removed, the device is now ready for the replacement. When installing the new screen, be sure to feed the display cable back through the hole provided for reconnection to the mainboard.

Category: Apple Watch. Subject: Glass/Digi Only Repair.
Tools required: sharp tip tweezers, plastic cards, sharp knife, spudger, heat gun, autoclave, soldering station, ruler, cutting board.
Instructions: Heat the screen up so that the entire display and watch are warm. Be sure to turn the device off first by holding down the crown then sliding to power off. Using a sharp blade start at the bottom right corner and lift the glass up enough to create a gap, once you have a large enough gap use a plastic tool to break the adhesive bond around the edges (Tools used: sharp) When inserting the knife & plastic tools around the edges be sure not to go further than 1mm into the AMOLED. The force touch gasket lies directly underneath the glass and is easily damaged if pushed on too hard with a knife or other metal object. The FPC clip is tricky but is easily removed using sharp point tweezers on the battery edge. (Tools used: sharp knife) I used a solder iron tip that was larger than the solder pads. Turn your soldering iron up to a high temperature, 350C is where I kept mine at. DO NOT add any solder, just use the heat & tweezers to pull back the tabs. After unsoldering pull the flex cable out of the way and use tweezers to peel back the proximity sensor from the AMOLED. CAREFULLY. (Tools used: sharp tip tweezers) After desoldering use a plastic spudger in the exact area as the picture shows to loosen up the adhesive holding the digi flex in place. It's best if you use a small amount of heat, around 150F, to help soften the adhesive bond. Fold the digi cable back as shown in the second picture. (Tools used: spudger) Begin by preheating the entire screen to a uniform temp, letting it sit under warm air for 10 minutes. I keep my heat gun on 300F-350F while holding the screen 3"-6" away from the nozzle to vary the temperature. Carefully insert a business card under the screen on the dig flex side. Use alcohol to weaken the OCA tape bond then move the card in slow (Tools used: heat gun) Keep inserting the card slowly while using alcohol as a de-bonder and lubricant as well as keeping uniform hot air blowing on the screen. While holding the outside of the glass continue rocking the card back and forth until the AMOLED is completely separated. (Tools used: plastic cards) The AMOLED screen is extremely thin, but not as fragile as you might expect, remember to be gentle and use heat through the entire separation process. To remove the old OCA adhesive use your finger and "roll" the glue off, pure isopropyl alcohol also helps to de-bond the adhesive. The screen is "waterproof" alcohol seeping into the edges is okay. (Tools used: heat gun) Be careful of the force touch flex cable that sticks into the frame on the bottom left of the display while removing the display assembly from the frame. The force touch gasket sits around the ENTIRE edge of the watch and is a thin silicone membrane. Test your AMOLED after separation before proceeding to the next steps. I will finish this guide after the new digitizer/glass assembly arrive. They are coming from China so it will be a few days still.

Guide: How to Wash and Dry Jeans.
Domain hierarchy 1: Patagonia Bottoms. Domain hierarchy 2: Bottoms. Domain hierarchy 3: Clothing. Domain hierarchy 4: Apparel. Domain hierarchy 5: Root.
Category: Patagonia Jeans. Subject: Not specified.
Tools required: washing machine, seventh generation natural liquid laundry soap, clothesline, clothespins.
Instructions: Lay your jeans out. Zip up the fly on your jeans. Don't forget to remove anything you may have left in the pockets. Button up your jeans. If your jeans have buttons or any other fasteners, be sure to close those as well. Put your arm through the pant leg of your jeans and grasp the hem. Turn the jeans inside out by pulling the hem of each leg through the waistband. Place your jeans in the washer. You can wash other clothes with your jeans, if they are dark colored. Set the load size. You can adjust this to whatever size load of laundry you are doing. Just be sure not to overload the washer, which not only is bad for your machine but creates additional wear on your clothes. Not sure what overloaded is? Check the guidelines in your user manual. A good rule of thumb is to only fill your washer 2/3 full. Set the water temperature on the washing machine to cold/cold. Hot water can damage the fibers of your jeans and cause them to shrink. Never wash your jeans in hot water. Start the washing machine on a gentle or normal wash cycle. (Tools used: washing machine) With the water running, pour in your laundry soap, following the instructions on the bottle. Never pour laundry detergent directly on clothing; always pour it into the water. Pouring soap directly onto the clothes may cause discoloration. We recommend [http://www.amazon.com/Seventh-Generation-Conc-Clear-32-Ounce/dp/B001FA1O3G/ref=br_lf_m_1000490281_2_32_ttl?ie=UTF8&m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&s=hpc&pf_rd_p=1260581682&pf_rd_s=center-2&pf_rd_t=1401&pf_rd_i=1000490281&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=071ZQYR1GHQFFEZKYAGN|Seventh Generation Free and Clear|new_window=true ] liquid laundry detergent. (Tools used: seventh generation natural liquid laundry soap) After the washer has stopped, remove your jeans from the washing machine and take them out to your laundry line. Never dry jeans in the dryer. The heat and tumbling can damage the fibers and shrink the jeans. Instead, hang your jeans up to dry using a laundry line, towel rack or even your shower head. You'll want to leave your jeans inside out to prevent color fading as they dry. Take one pant leg and fold the cuff over the line, overlapping the back side of the pant leg by a few inches. (Tools used: seventh generation natural liquid laundry soap, washing machine) Grab a clothespin and clip it in the middle of the pant leg, securing it to the laundry line. Always place your clothespins vertically. Placing clothespins at an angle can cause warping in the clothes or can cause the clothespin to fall apart. (Tools used: clothespins) Take the second pant leg and fold the cuff over the line, as you did before. Space this cuff so that the jeans hang as flat as possible. Apply a second clothespin to the middle of the second pant leg, catching the line between two layers. Allow your pants to dry completely before removing the clothespins and taking them down. To prevent your jeans from getting stiff, don't leave them out in the hot sun after they have dried. As soon as they are dry, take them down. (Tools used: clothespins)

Category: Watch. Subject: Not specified.
Tools required: tweezers, thin blade, pointed tip instrument.
Instructions: To make your watch easier to work with, start by taking off the straps. Pull down the strap until the lug can be accessed. Pull down on the lug and it should freely come out of place. The lugs have springs in them so when removing, be careful not to let them fly out of your work space. Locate the divot on the underside of the watch. Carefully place your thin blade in the divot and pop the buckle off of your watch. (Tools used: thin blade) Use your tweezers to grab onto the plastic holder and gently pull it out. (Tools used: tweezers) Apply pressure with the pointed tip instrument at the spot circled; around where the stem meets the main part of the watch. While applying pressure, pull the stem out and it should freely come off. (Tools used: pointed tip instrument) Gently place the tweezers underneath the hands of your watch. To remove the hands, carefully pry upwards and all of the hands should pop off. In order to not accidentally scratch the face of your watch, place a piece of paper under where you will be prying up the hands. (Tools used: tweezers) Using your tweezers place the hour hand in the center of the watch. Press down on the hand, so that the hour hand is firmly attached to the center post. Align the hour hand with the 3 O'clock position on your watch. Be careful handling the hands because they can be very fragile.

Guide: How to Fix a Ripped Shirt Hem.
Domain hierarchy 1: Clothing. Domain hierarchy 2: Apparel. Domain hierarchy 3: Root.
Category: Tops. Subject: Not specified.
Tools required: fabric scissors, iron, sewing thread, sewing pins, sewing needle.
Instructions: Turn your shirt inside out. Find your shirt's ripped hem. If the shirt has any loose strings, trim them. Iron the area of the shirt where the hem is ripped. If the hem is ripped several inches, you might want to insert sewing pins to keep the fabric in place. It's important to iron because it allows for easier sewing when the shirt stays folded the same way as the non-ripped part of the hem. The iron will be very hot. Be careful as to not burn yourself. (Tools used: sewing pins, iron) Acquire a sewing needle and thread. Take your thread and loop it through the eye of the needle, the hole at the end of the needle. You'll want the thread to be the same color and shade as the original thread. For visual purposes, I will use red in place of black. The needle is sharp. (Tools used: sewing needle, sewing thread) Pull the thread through the needle so that there is an equal length on each side of the needle. Tie the end of the thread together by making a knot. Making an additional knot over the first makes it more secure. (Tools used: sewing needle, sewing thread) Starting on the inside of the shirt, poke the needle through toward the side that is right-side-out. Sew over the original thread for about half an inch to ensure that it's thread won't rip again. (Tools used: sewing needle, sewing thread) Once the needle and thread is pulled through the side that is right-side-out, you will push it back through as close to the original hole as you can. Doing this will make the visible hem as hidden as possible. (Tools used: sewing) When you're back on the inside of the hem, make the next stitch a couple millimeters over and diagonal from the first. Continue this pattern so that the inside has diagonal stitches, and the outside has small, staggered dots. Finish sewing the hem. Make sure the last stitch is on the inside of the shirt. Make a knot where you intend for the pattern to stop. It's important to tie the knot as close to the fabric as possible. Doing this secures the stitching. (Tools used: fabric scissors, sewing) Cut off excess thread. (Tools used: sewing thread)

Tools required: fabric scissors, needle, thread.
Instructions: Examine the damaged area. Make sure to clean all the debris from the tear. Flip your pants inside out. Pinch hole together. Make sure there is no gaps showing. Pin needle and thread through pants. Use more thread than needed so you will have enough. Make sure your hand is not  directly behind the needle where you are poking. This will prevent you from pricking yourself. (Tools used: thread, needle) Pull needle and thread through pants  until there is only 2 inches of thread left. Tie a knot at the end of the remaining 2 inches. It can be any measurement, but 2 inches makes it easier to tie a knot without wasting too much thread. (Tools used: thread) Take the needle and pin it through right next to the previous spot. Pull all the way through until thread is tight. Repeat this process until you reach the end of the hole. (Tools used: thread, needle) Wrap the thread three times around the needle. Pull the needle until the thread is tight. This will tie a knot at the end. (Tools used: needle) Take the scissors and cut the excess string remaining. (Tools used: fabric scissors) Now put your khaki pants on because they are now wearable again and practically new!

Guide: How to Repair a Hole on the Shoe Sole.
Domain hierarchy 1: Apparel. Domain hierarchy 2: Root.
Category: Shoe. Subject: Not specified.
Tools required: 120 grit sand paper, paper towels, ice cube, duct tape.
Instructions: Scrape off any extra material near the area of the hole that is not part of the outsole of the shoe. Clean the outsole with a wet paper towel. Clean and dry the outsole with a paper towel before starting. (Tools used: paper towels) Use the 120 grit sandpaper to roughen the edges of the hole on the outsole. This helps the shoe goo adhere more readily to the outsole. (Tools used: 120 grit sand paper) Pull the insole out of the shoe. Apply duct tape inside the shoe (on the other side of the hole). Make sure the duct tape covers up the entire hole, so there will be no shoe goo going through the sole into the shoe. For holes that ripped through the shoe sole and to the inside of the shoe, this step is very important. (Tools used: duct tape) Apply the shoe goo to fill up the hole on the outsole. Apply enough shoe goo to cover up all of the areas of the hole. Spread the shoe goo evenly with an ice cube to cover up any uncovered area. The shoe goo will not stick to the ice cube, and you will be able to easily spread the shoe goo. The coldness of the ice also helps the shoe goo set in place. (Tools used: ice cube) Let the shoe sit for 24 hours for the shoe goo to dry. In this period, do not let any objects come into contact with the glue. After 24 hours, remove the duct tape from the shoe. Place the insole back into the shoe. (Tools used: duct tape) Use the 120 grit sand paper to rub the surface of the outsole until the shoe goo portion is smooth. (Tools used: 120 grit sand paper)

Domain hierarchy 1: Pebble Smartwatch. Domain hierarchy 2: Smartwatch. Domain hierarchy 3: Apparel. Domain hierarchy 4: Root.
Category: Pebble. Subject: Not specified.
Tools required: t5 torx screwdriver, metal spudger.
Instructions: This is a guide to fix the E-Paper tearing in Pebble 301BL devices. Using a T5 Torx screwdriver, remove the 4 screws on the back. When removing the back cover be very gentle!  The rumble motor may be adhered to the cover so you must pry it away. [https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Parts/T5-Torx-Screwdriver/IF145-039-3|iFixit T5 Torx screwdriver] (Tools used: t5 torx screwdriver) Locate the video connector near the bottom, right next to the device that vibrates when you get a notification. During normal use, this cable becomes loose and creates the tearing effect. In the next step, you will be shown a way to apply pressure to this and keep it constantly connected. What worked for me is taking a little toilet tissue or paper towel and placing it over the video connector. One way to test that this will help is by holding a finger on it and cycling through the menus. Nothing inside the device will catch the paper on fire, so there is nothing to worry about. Once you have confirmed that the paper will apply the necessary pressure, you can then put the screws back in. If the case doesn't seem to close properly as it did before, do not keep on trying to tighten the screw down; you will strip the screw. If the case doesn't close properly, you will need to open the device back up and remove a tiny bit of the paper until it does close, that way it will retain its water resistance. Here is an example of the final result.

Domain hierarchy 1: Fastener. Domain hierarchy 2: Clothing. Domain hierarchy 3: Apparel. Domain hierarchy 4: Root.
Category: Zipper. Subject: A zip on a jacket.
Tools required: yarn, sewing machine, seam ripper, fabric scissors, tweezers, wire cutter.
Instructions: Separate the seams of the broken zip using the seam ripper. It’s best to begin on the outside of the jacket. (Tools used: seam ripper) Next, separate the seam between the jacket and the front flap. (Tools used: seam ripper) After you´ve separated the seam between the jacket and the front flap,  you’ll see the lining of your jacket. (Tools used: seam ripper) Then you can separate the zip from the jacket. After you’ve separated the zip and front flap from the jacket, you’ll need to separate the zip from the front flap. You should then have both sides of the zip and the front flap laying before you. Measure the length of the zip that you’ve removed and mark the length on the new zip. Use the tweezers to crimp the zip stop onto the new zip in the correct position. (Tools used: tweezers) Cut off any excess zip approx. 2 cm beyond the zip stop. Use the wire cutters to pry off the zip teeth after the stopper. (Tools used: wire cutter) Then remove any leftover pieces with the seam ripper. (Tools used: seam ripper) Fold over the seam allowance of the zip and sew it down with the sewing machine. (Tools used: sewing machine) Put the inlay aside. Position the pocket attachment correctly and sew it on to the closure edge. Sew the zip onto the front flap using the zip foot. Sew the front flap with the zip attached onto the jacket lining. Sew the remaining zip half (without flap) onto the other side of the open jacket. Sew along the zip again on the outer fabric. (Tools used: fabric scissors) Smooth out the other half of the jacket, aligning the two sides together using a seam that comes together or other design element. This is important so that the zip is correctly aligned at the end. (Tools used: seam ripper) Then sew the second side of the zip on. Move the slider as you sew to keep it out of the way. The last step is to re-sew the hem seam. If any sewing holes are still visible in the jacket, you can close them using the steam setting on an iron. Be sure that the iron does not touch the jacket!

Guide: How can I resew a loose Velcro on a Vaude jacket?.
Domain hierarchy 1: Clothing. Domain hierarchy 2: Apparel. Domain hierarchy 3: Root.
Category: Outerwear. Subject: Not specified.
Tools required: yarn, sewing machine, seam ripper, utility scissors.
Instructions: If the Velcro comes loose on the outer flap of your jacket, you can easily sew it back on using matching thread. If the loop side of the Velcro comes loose, it’s a little harder to fix. We’ll show you in detail how to accomplish this. Using the seam ripper, completely take out the seam of the jacket flap for about 10 cm where the Velcro is loose. The more of the seam you take out, the better the new sewing on the Velcro will be. (Tools used: seam ripper, sewing machine) Thread the sewing machine with matching thread and place the sewing machine foot as near to the edge of the Velcro as possible. Sew until you get to the corner. (Tools used: sewing machine) Stop at the first corner and lift the sewing machine foot, leaving the needle in the Velcro. Turn the jacket, put down the foot and continue to stitch. When you get back to where you started, lock down the thread by making a few stitches back and forth. (Tools used: sewing machine) To finish the repair, resew the opened flap.

Guide: How to Lengthen Dress Pants.
Domain hierarchy 1: Clothing. Domain hierarchy 2: Apparel. Domain hierarchy 3: Root.
Category: Bottoms. Subject: Not specified.
Tools required: a pair of pants, thread, single fold bias tape, fabric scissors, seam ripper, ruler.
Instructions: Start by '''carefully''' ripping the seam of the pants with a seam ripper. Make sure not to leave holes in the fabric or it will show in the finished product. (Tools used: seam ripper) Next, iron the crease left previously by the seam. Some fabrics cannot take high heat. Consult the tag of the garment for ironing instructions. Consider placing layers of fabric between the iron and garment to reduce heat. (Tools used: seam ripper, fabric scissors) Try on the pants. Have a partner pin the pants to the desired length. If you do not have someone to help, measure the inseam of the pants and pin to the desired length. (Tools used: a pair of pants) Measure the width of the pant leg, double that measurement, and add 1.5 inches for seam allowance. Cut the bias tape to match this width. (Tools used: single fold bias tape) Sew the bottom of the pant to the edge of the bias tape. Make sure to remove pins while sewing as you move the work closer to the needle to avoid damaging the machine. (Tools used: single fold bias tape) Fold the bias tape underneath (about 3/4" -1") and iron flat. Make sure that the bias tape is not visible. Pin the two layers together. (Tools used: single fold bias tape) Sew the new seam of the pants. If sewing with a machine, consult the machine's manual on how to do a blind stitch.  If sewing by hand, use a tacking stitch. Make sure to only sew the two layers of fabric and not the entire pant-- this will cause the leg of your pants to not have an opening. (Tools used: a pair of pants) Repeat steps 1-7 for the other pant leg and iron flat. (Tools used: a pair of pants)

Domain hierarchy 1: Clothing. Domain hierarchy 2: Apparel. Domain hierarchy 3: Root.
Category: Outerwear. Subject: Not specified.
Tools required: utility scissors, sewing machine, yarn, tailor s chalk, protractor.
Instructions: Using a piece of tailor’s chalk, outline the size of the patch you’ll need to fully cover the area. In order to ensure that the patch looks good and fits the garment, take note of any seams or design elements you can use to design your patch. (Tools used: tailor s chalk) Transfer the size and shape of the patch to an appropriate piece of fabric for the patch. Add 1 cm for a seam allowance along the entire patch. Cut along the outer line of the patch. Fold over the seam allowance on the patch and iron it down – this will help with sewing the patch on. (Tools used: sewing machine) Lay the patch on the marked line and top stitch it to the fabric close to the edge of the patch. You can use pins to attach the patch to the jacket so it won’t slide around while you’re sewing it on. (Tools used: sewing machine) Use a top stitch to sew around the patch, locking off the first and last stitches by stitching back and forth a few times. Cut away the torn area inside the jacket along the new seam.

Domain hierarchy 1: Clothing. Domain hierarchy 2: Apparel. Domain hierarchy 3: Root.
Category: Tops. Subject: Not specified.
Tools required: utility scissors, yarn, needle, thimble.
Instructions: Cut a length of thread about 40 cm long. Insert one end of the thread through the eye of the needle. (Tools used: needle) Turn the sweater inside out. Insert the needle through the garment at your starting point at the top of the hole. Pull the thread through until only about 5 cm of thread is overlapping. Before inserting the thread on the other side of the hole, pick up any open stitches so that no other stitches come loose. Cut away any overlapping threads from the hole so that the loose stitches are more visible. (Tools used: needle) Continue to pick up any stitches that still exist. Repeat this procedure as long as it takes to pick up all stitches around the hole. Then stitch across a row of stitches weaving in and out of the stitches you just made. When the hole is closed sufficiently, you can tie off your thread. To do this, insert the needle several times through the same point in your fabric. Then cut off the thread. (Tools used: needle)

Guide: Replace rubber band.
Domain hierarchy 1: Apparel. Domain hierarchy 2: Root.
Category: Clothing. Subject: Not specified.
Tools required: needle, thread, fabric scissors.
Instructions: Measure the new rubber band to the appropriate length. To do this, put the rubber band around the waist or waist and stretch slightly. The rubber band must be adjusted so that the garment later has enough tension to not slip. Then add 1-5 cm seam allowance and cut. Uncover the old rubber band. To do this, carefully cut the seam in an inconspicuous area on the inside of the waistband with the scissors or the seam splitter so that the fabric is not damaged. For some garments, there is already an opening for an additional cord, then you can simply use the existing opening. Grasp the old rubber band with the point of the scissors or with your fingers and pull it out a little bit. Now cut the old rubber band. (Tools used: fabric scissors) Tie the new rubber band to the old rubber band. Only knot so tightly that the knot can be loosened again later. Now pull on the other end of the old rubber band, so that the new rubber band is pulled in piece by piece. Do not pull so far that the end of the new rubber band is pulled through! The best way to secure the end of the new rubber band with the darning needle for safety is to prevent the rubber band from twisting during retraction. (Tools used: needle) As soon as the knot becomes visible at the beginning of the new rubber band, the knot can be loosened and the old rubber band can be used for textile recycling or for tying tomatoes :-) Now put the two ends of the new elastic band together so that they overlap 1-5 centimeters according to the seam allowance. Cut off a piece of thread. The color of the thread can be chosen freely, as you will not see this seam later. Thread one end of the thread through the suture needle tube. Make a simple knot at the longer end. (Tools used: thread) Pierce the needle from the back about 2mm from the top edge through both ends of the rubber band. Pull through the needle until the thread is tight and the knot is caught at the back of the rubber band. Sew along the edge until the end of the seam allowance is reached. (Tools used: needle) Pierce the thread on the other edge and do the same here (Tools used: thread) If both edges are sewn together, do not completely pull through the thread at the last stitch, but catch the forming loop with your finger. Do not pull the thread tight yet. Insert the needle into the loop and pull it through. Now pull the thread tight so that the loop closes and a knot is formed. Cut off the protruding thread and stow the needle and the remaining thread safely for the next time ;-) (Tools used: thread, needle) Now stretch the waistband so far that the elastic band gradually disappears into the waistband due to the tension. If you like, you can now sew up the opening that you might have had to tie in the beginning with a few stitches, we leave this unobtrusive opening open for a possible later replacement of the rubber band.

Guide: Ballet Slipper Elastic Drawstring Replacement.
Domain hierarchy 1: Apparel. Domain hierarchy 2: Root.
Category: Shoe. Subject: Elastic Drawstring.
Tools required: fine needle, stitch opener, fabric glue.
Instructions: Locate the end of the elastic that is stuck within the ballet casing Use a fine needle to rip a few of the stitches in order to open the exact area where the elastic is stuck to release it You may also use a stitch opener in replacement of the fine needle if preferred Fine needle can be found at Walmart in the sewing aisle. The one used is the brand "Dritz" and included 6 different sized needles. The one used is the smallest needle in the kit. (Tools used: fine needle) Remove all of the elastic out of the shoe completely by gently pulling one end Put one end of the elastic through the thin needle. Leave enough of a tail on the thread in order to ensure it does not come unthreaded (Tools used: fine needle) Rethread the shoe by putting the needle through one end and pushing it through to the other opening This may be a bit tricky since the needle is super straight and the ballet shoe is curved. Use force to push the needle all the way through but be cautious not to stick yourself with the sharp end when doing so Keep in mind that this may be the most difficult or time consuming part of the repair depending on the specific slipper and/or strength used (Tools used: fine needle) Once elastic is evenly pulled through the ballet casing, secure the knot and cut the leftover elastic, if necessary It may help to fit the ballet slipper to the ballerina's foot prior to securing the knot to ensure the elastic is adjusted specifically their size You  may also use fabric glue to seal the spot where you’ve broken the stitches, or if it appears in good condition, leave stitching broken and cut down any excess hanging thread. The few broken stitches do not affect the ballerina’s performance in the shoe. It will still be in perfect working/wearing condition (Tools used: fabric glue)

Guide: Samsung Gear S2 Bezel Replacement.
Domain hierarchy 1: Samsung Smartwatch. Domain hierarchy 2: Smartwatch. Domain hierarchy 3: Apparel. Domain hierarchy 4: Root.
Category: Samsung Gear S2. Subject: Bezel.
Tools required: opening tool, cotton swab.
Instructions: Insert a plastic opening tool under the bezel, and then pry the bezel up. (Tools used: opening tool) When prying the bezel off, ensure that you don't apply too much force and lose the 3 components needed for reassembly. Doing this over a container to catch the parts is a useful safety measure. 1: Metal Bezel Ring 2: Plastic Retainer 3: The Watch Itself Cleaning the metal bezel can be done using the tool previously used to pry the bezel off. There is a small ridge along the inside that will collect gunk. Running the edge of your pry tool through this ridge will clean out anything stuck in there, and make step 5 much easier. Cleaning the plastic retainer will require much more care than the bezel, due to how fragile it is. Holding it carefully in between two fingers, gently rub a cotton swab against the part that is supported by your finger holding the retainer. Rotate the retainer as you clean the surface to ensure full coverage. (Tools used: cotton swab) The side of the retainer that has a ridged surface needs to face down in the watch. The retainer sits in the groove around the inside of the metal bezel as shown in the image. Take notice of the orientation of the retainer in the image. The retainer should seat in the groove on the bezel without applying force. Once you have the retainer seated in the bezel, place the bezel face down on your watch face placing the side with the [https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/V5WpCtdt5KFUuqXH|split|new_window=true] in the retainer down first. If you do not do this, the retainer may not seat properly, as shown in the first photo. If that happens, gently pry the bezel and retainer up by hand, re-seat the retainer in the bezel, and try again. Once you have successfully replaced your bezel on the watch, it should feel like new and rotate freely again.

Rotate the fabric so the zipper foot is perpendicular to the zipper tape. Position the zipper foot on top of the fabric 1/8th of an inch from where the zipper tape meets the garment. Sew back and forth at least 6 times to seal the end. This ensures that the zipper tab does not come off when you zip it up. Flip garment over to see the stitch line you just made. Cut off excess zipper tape. (Tools used: fabric scissors) Pull up your newly replaced zipper. Be proud of yourself! You've just replaced an invisible zipper!

Avoid using embroidery floss, dental floss, or rope. Choose a needle, preferably one that is small and thin. Smaller needles leave smaller holes in the garment and are less likely to cause issues while sewing. (Tools used: sewing needle, thread) Cut an arm's length of the thread. Shorter lengths of thread are easier to manage while sewing.  Longer pieces will tangle and knot. (Tools used: thread) Take the cut length of thread and poke it through the eye (hole) of the needle. Take your time!  This step requires concentration and patience. Pull the thread through the eye of the needle until it is about a hand's length. You should now be looking at a threaded needle with thread long on one side and short on the other. (Tools used: thread) Take the threaded needle and make a simple double knot on the long end of the thread. Snip off the extra thread near the knot. (Tools used: thread) Check the garment and cut off any old pieces of thread from the clasp area. Keep in mind that this step is only necessary if the old thread from the previous sewn binding is in the way of your repair. (Tools used: thread) Hold the clasp firmly in its desired place. Poke the needle through the inside of the garment, aiming for the inside of the clasp. Remember to always check whether or not your fingers are in the way while sewing.  Otherwise you will poke your fingers! The end knot on the thread should always be hidden on the inside of the garment.  In this example, the knot was hidden beneath the extra material on the inside of the garment.  This is known as the seam allowance. Pull the needle through until the knot catches and you are unable to pull anymore. (Tools used: sewing needle, thread) Flip to the outside of the garment. Check to ensure that the needle is placed on the outside of the clasp before continuing. Poke the needle through the fabric.  Aim for a spot in the garment's seam to hide your new stitches. Pull the needle all the way through until the thread has snugly pushed the clasp close to the garment's fabric. (Tools used: sewing needle, thread) Turn the garment to the inside again. Poke the needle through the fabric, aiming for the inside of the clasp. Tug the needle all the way through until it catches. Repeat Steps 7-9 as many times as necessary.  This action creates a group of stitches that hold the clasp in place. More repetitions of the stitches will create a sturdier binding for the clasp. (Tools used: sewing needle) Make sure to end your last stitch on the inside of the garment. Poke the needle through the stitches you made and tug until there is a loop. Make sure that the loop is big enough to maneuver the needle through, but not so big that it tangles. Take the needle and pull it through the center of the loop. Pull the needle through the center of the loop again. (Tools used: sewing needle) Pull on the needle until a knot is formed on top of your stitches. Straighten the threaded needle and hold it firmly. Take a pair of scissors and snip off the extra thread. Check to make sure you do not accidentally cut off the knot too! (Tools used: sewing needle, thread) Examine the finished repair in good light. Test the clasp to ensure that it works properly. Check the garment and make sure that the repair stitches are not too noticeable from the outside.

Guide: How to Repair a Bra Underwire.
Domain hierarchy 1: Apparel. Domain hierarchy 2: Root.
Category: Clothing. Subject: Not specified.
Tools required: thread, needle, utility scissors, fabric adhesive.
Instructions: Push the underwire into the hole until it is no longer visible. Thread the needle. Pull the thread to a length of about 8 inches. Match the length of the thread on each side of the loop and cut with the scissors. Doubling up the thread in this way allows for stronger and longer-lasting stitches. (Tools used: thread) Loop both ends of the thread around your index finger. Pinch the ends of the thread between your index finger and thumb and roll your index finger downwards until the loop slips off. Carefully take hold of the loop and pull to create a knot. Sometimes the knot created the first time may not be large enough. Repeat the last three instructions a second time to make a larger knot. (Tools used: thread) Insert the needle just above the tear in the bra where the underwire came out. This ensures that the hole will not expand any further and provides extra stability in the stitches. Handle the needle with care to not accidentally injure yourself! (Tools used: needle) Use a whip stitch to mend the tear. Pull the needle through the fabric until the knot at the end of the thread approaches the incision. On the opposite side,  insert the needle again at a point just after the first incision and pull it through the fabric. Continue this pattern two or three stitches below the tear. (Tools used: thread, needle) Repeat the process from Step 4 going back upwards towards the tear, over your current stitching. This gives your stitches extra reinforcement to make sure the tear is not reopened or pushes through the stitches. Close the stitch. Near your first incision,  where the knot is, insert the needle into the fabric halfway through. Wind the leftover thread around the  sharp end of the needle 3-4 times, then pull the needle through completely. Tug on the needle upwards to tighten the knot created. (Tools used: needle) Trim the thread with scissors. Leave a few millimeters of thread leftover to ensure that the knot does not come loose. Optional: use a small amount of fabric adhesive over the stitching to fully reinforce it and seal the tear. Leave it without glue and you are done. (Tools used: thread, fabric adhesive)

Domain hierarchy 1: Apparel. Domain hierarchy 2: Root.
Category: Eyeglasses. Subject: Monofilament Lens Retainer.
Tools required: tweezers, utility scissors, wire cutter.
Instructions: Inspect frame to make certain the Monofilament Lens Retainer is broken. If the wire is not broken, your lens has fallen out and can easily be re-inserted. If the wire is broken refer to the following steps. (Tools used: wire cutter) Remove the old wire/string from the spectacles using the tweezers as shown in the pictures to the right. (Tools used: tweezers) Cut the new fishing wire between 7 and 9 inches. (Tools used: wire cutter) Hold the glasses in the position shown in the image. There will be a hole near the nose pad, shown by the arrow in the second photo, you will use this to insert the new wire. (Tools used: wire cutter) Insert one end of the wire into the hole near the pad arm and insert the other end to the opposite side of the glasses, then tie the knot as shown in the images. (Tools used: wire cutter) You will see a thin groove along the edge of the glasses. Carefully fix the wire around the groove as shown in the pictures. (Tools used: wire cutter) After placing the wire around the glasses, stretch the wire, tie it, and make a knot by holding the glasses tightly. Do not tie a knot at the end of wire, but at the location where the wire is holding the glasses tightly. (Tools used: wire cutter) Now, cut the extra wire from both sides of the glasses using the nail cutter. Use of scissors might make it difficult to cut extra wire. So, we suggest you use nail cutter to cut extra wire. Pay extra attention while cutting a wire, as you might cut more than needed and loosen it, which could lead you to start over. (Tools used: wire cutter) In the end, check if your glasses are tight enough to wear. If the glasses are tight, they are ready to wear.

Guide: How to mend a hitch in an almost invisible way.
Domain hierarchy 1: Apparel. Domain hierarchy 2: Root.
Category: Clothing. Subject: Not specified.
Tools required: fabric scissors, flat iron, sewing needle, thread, new item.
Instructions: To mend a hitch, you only need a few accessories: thermo-sticky cloth, an iron, wire, a needle, a pair of scissors and ... a little patience! It is better to wash the piece of clothing first. Thus, the glue will adhere better to the fabric. Iron the hole to flatten the edges and cut any excess wires to get clean, sharp edges. (Tools used: flat iron, fabric scissors) Cut the thermo-adhesive fabric to the correct size. The piece should be slightly larger than the hitch. Round the corners. Angles may peel off more easily. (Tools used: fabric scissors) Lay the canvas side glue (this is the brightest side) on the wrong side of the fabric. Secure it with the iron by pressing firmly on the iron and making it move back and forth and rotate. Read carefully the garment label and the instructions for use of the thermo-adhesive fabric. Follow the instructions for iron temperature and ironing time. Otherwise you risk burning the fabric and / or the thermo-adhesive fabric. (Tools used: flat iron, fabric scissors) The canvas is now glued, but to make sure it does not peel off after a few washes, it is better to sew the edge to the fabric. Choose a colored thread close to that of the fabric so that the seam is seen as little as possible. Thread the thread on a needle and tie a knot at the end. Starting from the wrong side of the fabric (so that the knot does not appear), sew the needle on both sides of the fabric along the edge of the piece of fabric. I prefer to work here on the place of the fabric to better control the visibility of the points. Once arrived at the end, make a knot again and cut the excess thread. There you go ! We see almost nothing! Who has a sewing machine, can obviously use it during this stage. But it's just as easy to hand :) (Tools used: sewing needle, thread, fabric scissors)

Domain hierarchy 1: Motorola Android Wear Smartwatch. Domain hierarchy 2: Smartwatch. Domain hierarchy 3: Apparel. Domain hierarchy 4: Root.
Category: Motorola Moto 360 2nd Gen. Subject: Battery Replacement.
Tools required: jimmy, spudger, t3 torx screwdriver, opening tool, tweezers, flathead screwdriver, opening tool, iopener.
Instructions: [https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iOpener+Heating/25705|Heat an iOpener|new_window=true] and place on the rear cover to soften the adhesive underneath. (Tools used: iopener) Insert an opening pick or opening tool in the small notch by the microphone hole, underneath the plastic trim ring. With the opening tool under the plastic ring, move the tool around the edge of the watch, gently prying up the ring as you go. (Tools used: opening tool) Use fingernails or an opening tool or pick to pry the plastic trim off of the button. Be careful to apply even pressure around the ring when prying, as there are three retainer prongs that can be broken if the ring is twisted or tilted while being pulled out. Use a small six pin spanner to unscrew the button from the case. If you don't have access to the proper spanner, you can use a pair of tweezers or a very small screwdriver to unscrew the button assembly. There is blue thread locker on these threads, so light heat on the button side of the case may help. Completely unthread this and remove the button assembly from the case. (Tools used: tweezers, opening tool) Insert a prying tool into the notch near the microphone and slide the tool around the edge of the assembly while gently prying the assembly out. The assembly is fitted very tightly into the case—it may take a little force to get your tool past the o-ring. Do not fully remove the internal assembly yet. There is a flex cable connecting the assembly to the watch display that needs to be disconnected before the assembly is completely removed. Use tweezers to remove a rubber strip on the back of the connector. Use a fingernail or the tip of a spudger to lift the small locking flap on the connector and disconnect the ribbon cable. (Tools used: tweezers, spudger) Gently pry the battery out of the case. The battery adhesive is stubborn, and the shield over the motherboard may come off with the battery. This is okay; use an opening pick to separate the battery and the shield, then snap the shield back onto the motherboard. Do not pull the battery all the way out after you separate it from the shield. There is a fragile battery cable that must be disconnected before the battery is completely removed. Remove the grey plastic piece that sits next to the battery. Use tweezers or the tip of a spudger to disconnect the battery connector. (Tools used: spudger, opening tool)

Guide: Oakley Penny (X-Metal) Tune-up.
Domain hierarchy 1: Eyeglasses. Domain hierarchy 2: Apparel. Domain hierarchy 3: Root.
Category: Oakley Penny (X-Metal). Subject: Nose bridge pins and flex couplers.
Tools required: t6 torx screwdriver, linegear pin pusher, bench vice, tweezers, round file 2 mm diameter.
Instructions: The flex couplers (fancy word for rubbers) inside the nose bridge will be replaced. To do that that, press-fit pins, which connect orbitals and nose bridge and also hold these flex couplers in position, need to be removed Though not mandatory, I advice disassembling the entire frame in order to be able to work free of obstacles. (Tools used: linegear pin pusher) Though this step is not strictly required, I recommend removing the lenses in order to avoid them getting scratched or being stressed, which in turn might lead to hair cracks. Open both orbitals by unscrewing T6 Torx Remove orbital gasket Remove lenses Remove nose pads (Tools used: t6 torx screwdriver) For Penny only, I recommend re-inserting the orbital screws to add more stiffness to the frame for the follwing steps (closed structures can take significantly more load). Penny is the only X-Metal with spring hinges on its ear stems. Removing the latter, requires putting quite some load onto the frame. (Removing ear stems on other X-metals is just a matter of unscrewing them. Make sure you don't loose the four slim plastic washers per ear stem on those models) Cover a bench vice with some old cloths so it won't scratch up your frame Clamp an orbital into the bench vice. The last picture is not showing the optimal position (refer to next step for that): the orbital screw should have been reinserted (not shown here) and the frame should be low in the bench and close to the hinge, so you can push against it without causing too much torsion on the frame. (Tools used: bench vice) The first picture shows an optimal position in the bench vice for removing an ear stem Grab the ear stem close to the hinge (the titanium alloy is probably strong enough not to buckle, but you don't want to find out) and give it a good push against the spring to alleviate any load from the screw. Don't be shy - if any frame, this one can take some abuse. When your pushing force balances the spring inside the frame, the T6 Torx screw is free of load and can be removed. The ear stems come with two sunk metal washers each that make it easy to re-install them compared to other X-Metals that come with four thin, flimsy plastic washers per ear stem (Tools used: t6 torx screwdriver, bench vice) Hint: In case you just received your pin pusher, I recommend filing down the pushing tip slightly: The idea is to increase the tip diameter so you can put less pressure on the rivets surface (less chance of deforming it), while maintaining the same force. Or in easier words, you want to distribute load: P=F/A (pressure=force over area) The tool's leaflet recommends filing it down 2mm. I have not tried since it seems a bit much. I filed it from a tip diameter of 0.9mm to 1.3mm. Due to its conical shape, you don't want to lose too much pusher tip length in order to be able to still fully push the pins out (!) Place the nose bridge flush on the tool's tube. Make sure pushing tip, pin and tube are in perfect alignment. By turning the handle on the pin pusher, slowly push out the pin from top to bottom Each pin might behave differently. Out of the four rivets (two frames) I removed, one took quite some force and came out with a small "pop". One took hard force and came out with a loud "bang". And two came out smooth as butter. (Tools used: round file 2 mm diameter, linegear pin pusher) Once you got the rivets out, you can pull out the orbitals as well as the old flex couplers  with tweezers Treat your nose bridge to a cleaning (Tools used: tweezers) Proceed with the second orbital as before 1. picture: Full Penny disassembly. 2. picture: On one side of my Penny, the spring hinge assembly came out. For the curious, this is what it looks like: a  spiral spring and a cam. It's easy to reinsert and if it doesn't come out by itself, leave it in. There's no need to remove it. 3: Picture: Original Oakley pin and gray nose bridge rubber. (Tools used: round file 2 mm diameter, linegear pin pusher) Add a replacement flex coupler to an orbital lug Push the lug into the nose bridge and align them with a rod (or round file) of 2mm diameter. Give it a wiggle to assure the alignment Use a 2mm round file to align and smoothen the pairing. Don't grind it down: you still need a press-fit for the replacement pin to stay in. But you want to give it a good cleaning and you need perfect (!) alignment to successfully re-insert the new pin. '''See step 11 for any mistakes you can make here, before proceeding to step 10.''' (Tools used: round file 2 mm diameter) The replacement pin should go in smoothly by hand from the back of the nosebridge Pushing the replacement pin in: Cover the pin pusher tool tube with a cloth to protect the nose bridge from scratches Place the nose bridge front down on the cloth-covered tube and slowly screw down the pusher tip until it just touches the pin Make sure pusher tip and pin are in perfectly straight alignment and then slowly push it in Don't push the pin all the way in (until the pin's rim touches the nose bridge). Check the front side in between how far you want the pin to stick out (if at all) (Tools used: linegear pin pusher) 1. Alignment / filing: reinserting the pins takes considerably more force than getting them out. However, as always, too much is too much - the problem being, if you do it for the first time, you don't know what is too little and what is much until it's too late. I had heard this can be a problem and had ordered extra pins just in case. At my very first try I didn't file the inside of the nose bridge bore much. Result: I wasn't able to push pin fully back in. I turned the frame around, pushed it back out, tried a new pin - it worked. On the other orbital, I had the same problem but couldn't even get the pin back out. It had deformed so much that it was moving neither back nor forth. Pulling its end with a caliper didn't help either. Wipe off the nervous sweat,  place the frame in the bench vice, get a 1.5mm drill and very carefully (!) drill a hole in the pin from the front. Make sure you don't touch the walls of the nose bridge bore (2mm diameter) - you don't want to widen the press-fit. Just pretend to be a dentist. When enough material is removed, pull out the culprit. Moral of the story: file, but don't grind. If the alignment isn't perfect the pin can get caught at an edge and will deform when pressure is applied. 2. Grinding down the pusher tip: Again, on my first try I hadn't done this enough (since I didn't know what was enough and how much is too much. 1.3mm diameter seems to work). This can result in very tiny spot marks on the back of the pin. Not bad at all but since you're at it... grind it down Additionally, you can try placing cardboard between the pusher tip and the pin. Some people have gone as far as machining tips with a wide end for reinsertion. (Tools used: bench vice, linegear pin pusher) If you follow the advice from the previous step ("learn from my mistakes"), getting the pins back in is not as hard as I made it sound. Having learned what I learned on the Penny, I was able to replace both pins of a Juliet (shown in the picture) in not more than 5min. Reassembly: Fasten the Penny frame in the bench vice again. Reinsert the spring hinge, if it came out. Push the ear stem against the spring hinge (hard!) until the holes of ear stem and frame align. Put the Torx  screw back in. Remove orbital screws, reinsert lenses, orbital screws and gaskets Add nose pads and give your baby a good cleaning. Enjoy a sunny day with your freshly tuned X-Metals that are now holding on to your head again snug as a face hugger. (Tools used: bench vice, linegear pin pusher)
