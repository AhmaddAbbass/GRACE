Add a teaspoon of Harissa Paste to the carrots and give it a good stir. Check the salt and spice levels and adjust to suit your taste. Make portions of the dough and keep aside. The dough portions will depend on how large your skillet is and how thick you want the pizza to be. Preheat a skillet, if you have a   even better. A regular heavy skillet will also work for the pizza. Grease the skillet and allow it to preheat while we roll out the pizza. Dust the pizza dough portions in flour and roll it out to fit the size of the skillet or frying pan.Then press the dough into the pan and cook over a medium heat for 8-10 mins or until the base is golden and you notice the top is rising and puffing up. We will be cooking the pizza on both sides like a bread. So flip over and cook for a few minutes on the opposite side as well. Once the pizza base has browned edges and has been cooked through, remove from the skillet. Proceed the same way with the remaining dough. The process of making this pizza will be more like a Naan. Keep the pizza bases aside. The next step is to assemble the Roasted Carrots Pizza with Pomegranate Sauce & Greek Yogurt Place the cooked pizza bases on a platter, smear the Greek Yogurt over the cooked pizza base, scatter the Harissa Roasted Carrots on the top and drizzle the Pomegranate Sauce over the Pizza. And your pizza is ready to be served.

Preparation Time: 45 M. Cooking Time: 45 M.\nIngredients: Basmati rice, Jackfruit Raw (Kathal), Onions, Ginger, Garlic, Bay leaves (tej patta), Cardamom (Elaichi) Pods/Seeds, Black cardamom (Badi Elaichi), Cloves (Laung), Whole Black Peppercorns, Cinnamon Stick (Dalchini), Star anise, Mace (Javitri), Nutmeg powder, Green Chillies, Red Chilli powder, Coriander Powder (Dhania), Salt, Mint Leaves (Pudina), Coriander (Dhania) Leaves, Lemon juice, Saffron strands, Caramelized onions, Cashew nuts, Raisins.\nInstructions: To begin making the Kathal Biryani Recipe, let us first cut the raw jackfruit. In order to do that we have to first, grease our hands and the knife that we are going to use, with some oil. This important tip ensures that the hands don't get sticky from the natural fruit latex/sap present in the fruit does not get onto your hands and makes the cutting process hassle-free.  Keep a bowl of water mixed with some salt, ready to put the cut raw jackfruit pieces to avoid discolouration of the fruit. Now that your hands and knife are well greased, cut the the jackfruit in half, discard the skin and start making 1 inch pieces and soak them in the salted water. Wash and soak rice in water for 30 mins before you start cooking. In a heavy bottomed vessel, heat water-twice the quantity of the rice. Add few drops of ghee, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, salt and some star anise in it. As soon as the water starts boiling, add rice and cook till 80% done. Once the rice is semi cooked to 80%, pass it through a strainer and collect the rice in a large tray and spread well so that they don't stick to each other. *To make kathal ki yakhni Heat ghee in a wok and fry the kathal pieces till brown in color. Keep aside. In the same wok, fry cashews, raisins that will be used for garish at the end. Collect them in separate bowls and keep aside. Now add all the whole spices along with bay leaf in the remaining ghee. Allow them to sizzle. Next add ginger and garlic and saute till light brown in color. At this stage, add finely chopped onions,fry till raw smell goes off and it turns golden in color. Add green chilies and mix well. Once the onions are cooked, add the fried kathal pieces and yogurt and mix everything nicely so that the curd mixes well with the kathal. Soon you will observe, yogurt will start releasing water. Cook till oil starts oozing out and yogurt starts drying up. To this, add red chili powder, coriander powder and some torn leaves of mint and coriander and fry till oil starts leaving from the sides. Add salt and give it a good stir. Turn off the flame.  Heat a flat base iron tawa on the gas and place a large thick bottomed utensil (handi/bhagona) on the tawa in which you wish to dum the biryani. Take 1 tablespoon of yogurt and spread it all over the base-this prevents yakhni from getting burnt. Spread the kathal yakhni all over the curd and make sure it's evenly spread on the base. Add some ghee over it and start covering it with layers of rice and caramelised onions.  Once you have covered the yakhni with the rice, pour saffron milk at one corner of the rice top. Squeeze lemon all over, add lots of chopped coriander and mint on top along with fried raisins and cashews-save few to garnish before serving. Cover the vessel with aluminium foil and seal it from the sides. Place the lid of the vessel on top of the foil and keep a heavy vessel over it so that the aroma is intact and the Kathal Biryani cooks well in dum. Simmer the gas and let the Kathal Biryani cook on dum for 20 minutes. Once the Kathal Biryani is done, remove the foil carefully and mix well by shaking the vessel. By doing this the yakhni mixes well with the rice without breaking the grains.  Serve the Kathal Biryani as a one dish meal for a weeknight dinner or as a party food along with   and  for a sumptuous meal..\nSummary: This recipe belongs to the Indian cuisine and is typically served as Lunch.\nIt is a vegetarian dish that uses Basmati rice, Jackfruit Raw (Kathal), Onions among other ingredients.\nReference: https://www.archanaskitchen.com/kathal-biryani-recipe-raw-jackfruit-pilaf"

Preparation Time: 15 M. Cooking Time: 30 M.\nIngredients: Tindora (Dondakaya/ Kovakkai), Onion, Dry Red Chilli, Methi Seeds (Fenugreek Seeds), Coriander (Dhania) Seeds, Cumin seeds (Jeera), Whole Black Peppercorns, Tamarind, Fresh coconut, Garlic, Turmeric powder (Haldi), Salt, Sunflower Oil.\nInstructions: To begin making the Mangalorean Manoli Curry Recipe; we will first steam cook the Manoli. You can use a pressure cooker or a steamer to cook it. Precooking the Manoli (Indian Gherkins) makes the cooking process faster and more nutritious too. I like to use a pressure cooker for steaming the vegetables. To do this, place the cut Manoli (Indian Gherkins) along with a pinch of salt and 2 tablespoons of water into the pressure cooker. Cover the pan, place the weight on and allow the vegetable to cook in the pressure cooker until you hear two whistles.   After a whistle, turn off the heat and you can place the pressure cooker under running water to release the pressure immediately. Releasing the pressure immediately, helps retain the fresh green color of the Gherkins and also gives it a perfectly cooked texture. Our next step is to make the Manoli Curry Masala.  In a small pan; roast the dry red chillies, fenugreek, coriander, cumin and black pepper until you can smell the roasted aromas. Add these to a small blender jar, along with the coconut, tamarind and turmeric powder. Grind the spices adding very little water to make a smooth curry paste. The Manoli curry paste is now ready. Keep aside. In the next step; heat a teaspoon of oil in a pan; add the chopped onions, and saute for a couple of minutes until the onions are soft and tender. Add the curry paste and saute for a couple of more minutes. Stir in the steamed gherkins, salt and add about 1-1/2 to 2 cups of water. You essentially want a thick gravy for the Manoli Curry; hence add water accordingly.  Give all the ingredients a good stir. Check the salt levels and adjust to suit your taste. Give the mixture a quick boil only when you are ready to serve.  Serve the Mangalorean Manoli Curry Recipe along with   and   for an everyday meal..\nSummary: This recipe belongs to the Mangalorean cuisine and is typically served as Side Dish.\nIt is a diabetic friendly dish that uses Tindora (Dondakaya/ Kovakkai), Onion, Dry Red Chilli among other ingredients.\nReference: https://www.archanaskitchen.com/mangalorean-manoli-curry-recipe-indian-gherkins-curry"

Diet type: Vegetarian.\nCategory: Paniyaram Recipes. Preparation Time: 10 M. Cooking Time: 20 M.\nIngredients: Carrots (Gajjar), Spinach, Salt, Mustard seeds, Green Chillies, Pearl onions (Sambar Onions), Coriander (Dhania) Leaves, Sunflower Oil.\nInstructions: To begin making Paniyaram With Idli/Dosa Batter Recipe, prep all the ingredients and keep them ready. Have the dosa batter ready - it's the classic dosa batter from idli rice and urad dal, soaked ground and fermented.  My next step is to prep all 3 variants and add to the batter and make paniyarams in a paniyaram pan.  First to cook the carrots, heat oil in over medium heat in a pan; add the carrots and saute until the carrots turn soft. Turn off the heat and allow the carrots to cool. Don't add any salt as yet, as the dosa batter has a little salt. Next cook the spinach; heat oil over medium heat in a pan; add the spinach and saute until the spinach wilts completely and once done, turn off the heat and keep aside to cool. Once cooled, add the carrots to the Mixer Grinder along with 1 cup of the dosa batter, pinch of salt and blend to make a smooth batter.  The reason I am blending with the batter is, I don’t have to add any additional water to the batter for grinding. Next for the spinach, add the spinach to the Mixer Grinder along with 1 cup of the dosa batter, pinch of salt and blend to make a smooth batter.  Keep both batters aside. The next step is to make spicy masala which will go into all three batters.  Heat oil in a pan, add the mustard seeds and allow it to crackle. Add the curry leaves, green chillies and chopped onion. Saute until the onion softens and turns lightly golden brown. Once done, turn off the heat. Divide this into 3 portions and add into the 3 batters (plain, carrot and spinach). Check the salt if required and add to taste. The final step is to cook the paniyarams. Add oil into each of the cavities. Spoon the batters into the cavity . Cover with a lid and steam until the top gets cooked. Once the top is steamed, open the lid and flip the paniyam and cook on the other side until golden and lightly crisp.  Transfer the paniyaram to a serving bow and serve it along with chutney for a hearty breakfast or even a snack. And this chutney is super simple to make - fresh grated coconut, along with a handful of almonds, a couple of green chillies, an inch piece ginger, salt and lemon. Blend using the Mixer Grinder and voila your chutney is ready in two minutes. And one small tip, if your coconut is cold or frozen, use warm water for grinding this chutney, you get the perfect texture. Serve Masala Paniyaram With Idli/Dosa Batter Recipe with   and   as a tea time snack..\nSummary: This recipe belongs to the South Indian Recipes cuisine and is typically served as South Indian Breakfast.\nIt is a vegetarian dish that uses Carrots (Gajjar), Spinach, Salt among other ingredients.\nReference: https://www.archanaskitchen.com/masala-paniyaram-with-leftover-idli-dosa-batter-recipe"

    "content": "Recipe: How to Make Homemade Jalebi Recipe.\nCuisine: North Indian Recipes. Course: Dessert. Diet type: Vegetarian.\nCategory: Sweet Recipes (Indian Mithai / Indian Dessert). Preparation Time: 10 M. Cooking Time: 530 M.\nIngredients: All Purpose Flour (Maida), Corn flour, Baking powder, Turmeric powder (Haldi), Oil, Sugar, Water, Saffron strands.\nInstructions: To begin making the Jalebi Recipe, we will first begin the preparation by mixing the maida, corn flour, baking soda, ghee and turmeric powder in a medium bowl.  Combine all the dry ingredients well, until well combined. Add yogurt to the dry ingredients and blend them all together to make a thick batter by adding very little water. The consistency of the batter should be thick and not watery, similar to the butter cream batter. You should be able to make a shape when piped in a piping bag. When done, cover the jalebi batter and place it in a warm place for 24 hours or overnight, till it is fermented (the batter will rise on fermentation). Once the batter is fermented stir the batter in a cut and fold motion to combine it once again. Dont over stir you want the air pockets in the batter to remain. This will help in the jalebi being crisp and also in turn help it absorb the sugar syrup. To make the sugar syrup, boil the sugar with water and saffron powder in a small bowl on medium heat until the sugar dissolves. When the sugar becomes thick and stringy of one string consistency.Turn off the heat and keep aside. Now to make the jalebis, preheat the oil for deep frying. Once the oil is hot enough, you will know this, when you add a drop of batter in and it will come rising to the top almost immediately. Once you have filled the piping bag, pipe spirals of the batter onto the medium hot oil, until you get at least 3 concentric circles. Fry the jalebi on medium heat until golden brown in colour and crisp. Once the jalebi is crisp and browned, drain the excess oil out and immediately dip the jalebi into the hot sugar syrup. Piping the jalebis into the medium hot oil takes a little experience, the more you pipe the more practice you will get and the better you get at it.  The Jalebis should rest in the sugar syrup for at least a minute, after which they can be drained out of the excess syrup and then served. Enjoy these crisp, sweet Homemade Jalebis as a wonderful dessert or a sweet option for your guests. Serve the Homemade Jalebi Recipe as a Indian Party Dessert for the festival of Holi or Diwali. Note: Ensure the batter is thick and firm, or else they won’t retain the shape of the jalebis. The oil for frying should be medium hot. If it is too hot, the jalebis will end up burnt. Also make sure you keep the heat on low when you pipe the jalebis into the oil, this will ensure you can see the circles you are piping and also the jalebis will rise up slowly..\nSummary: This recipe belongs to the North Indian Recipes cuisine and is typically served as Dessert.\nIt is a vegetarian dish that uses All Purpose Flour (Maida), Corn flour, Baking powder among other ingredients.\nReference: https://www.archanaskitchen.com/homemade-jalebi"

Cooking Time: 25 M.\nIngredients: All Purpose Flour (Maida), Baking soda, Salt, Oil, Pistachios, Sugar, Water, Cardamom Powder (Elaichi).\nInstructions: To begin making the Balushahi (Badusha) recipe, we have to follow a two stage cooking process. First is to make the fried dough and second the sugar syrup.  To make the dough In a large bowl add in the flour, the salt and a 1/4 teaspoon of soda. Stir to combine the dry ingredients . Next add in the ghee to the flour mixture. Using your fingers combine the flour and ghee to make coarse crumbs . Its takes a good one minute to get this texture. Once you get the coarse crumbs texture, add in the yogurt. knead just enough until all the ingredients come together. Cover the dough with a wet muslin cloth and allow it to rest for about 30 minutes After 30 minutes of resting the dough we will divide the dough into equal portions of large lemon size, making a dent in the center with the thumb. Take care not to press too much while shaping them as this can cause cracks in them. Cover the dough portions with a wet cloth and allow them to rest for another 15 minutes. Next, preheat the oil for deep frying. Start adding a few balls at a time into the oil and fry them on medium heat. The medium heat helps the balushahi to cook evenly from the inside. Once you notice that the dough balls come floating up to the surface flip over and fry until the bottom half is darker golden brown. Remember it is important to fry them on medium heat and not high heat so it gets evenly cooked from the inside. Once both sides are browned well, drain and continue the same with the remaining dough portions and keep them aside. Now let's get the ingredients needed for the sugar syrup. In a sauce pan add in 1/4 cup of water, 1 cup of sugar and a teaspoon of cardamom powder.  With heat on medium, stir the mixture well until the sugar dissolves and the mixture comes to a boil. Once the mixture comes to a boil, add in the cardamom powder, turn the heat to low and allow the mixture to simmer until you get a single thread consistency. You will know that it has reached the single thread when you touch the sugar syrup between your fingers, you will find it sticky. And when the syrup drips from the spoon it will look a longer drop. We will now dip each of the fried doughs one at a time in the sugar syrup until it gets coated all around and arrange then on a platter. Continue the same with the remaining fried dough. Garnish the Balushahi (Badusha) with pistachios and allow them to rest until the sugar hardens. Make these delicious flaky Balushahi for Diwali and share it with friends and family who come visiting you.

Stir in the chopped coriander leaves and check the salt and spice levels. Adjust to suit your taste. Adjust the consistency of the dal, by adding water.

Once the coal is red hot, place it in a heatproof bowl. Place this bowl on top of the cooked lentils. Drizzle a teaspoon of ghee over the hot coal. The coal will begin to smoke almost instantly. At this stage, cover the dal pan and allow the smoke to circulate inside. This process of smoking a dal, is called Dhungar or Coal Smoking Technique. After about a minute, open the dal pan and you will see the smoke effect has withered. Transfer the Smoked Dhaba Dal to a serving bowl. For the seasoning; heat a teaspoon of ghee in a small pan; add the cumin seeds, the slivered garlic, and red chillies. Allow the cumin to crackle for a few seconds and turn off the heat.

Preparation Time: nan. Cooking Time: nan.\nIngredients: Red Radish, Tomatoes, Cherry tomatoes, Cucumber, Mooli/ Mullangi (Radish), Spring Onion Bulbs, Spring Onion Greens, Parsley leaves, Salad leaves, Mint Leaves (Pudina), Fresh Pomegranate Fruit Kernels, Lemon juice, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Sumac, White wine vinegar, Water, Garlic, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Pomegranate juice, Sugar, Mini Pita Breads, Sumac.\nInstructions: To begin making the Fattoush Recipe, we will first prepare the dressing and chop up all he ingredients for the salad. First add the sumac to the warm water, stir to dissolve and set the mixture aside for at least 15 minutes. Meanwhile slice and chop all the salad ingredients. Next, squeeze fresh lemon juice into the water into which you mixed the sumac. Add vinegar, crushed garlic, salt and whisk it together. I used white wine vinegar, but red wine vinegar could be substituted, or you could skip the vinegar altogether, since there is also lemon juice. At this stage, add the olive oil in a slow steady stream to the dressing, while whisking continuously. This will help the oil mix with the other ingredients and create a translucent emulsion that is smooth and uniform in flavour. Place the dressing in a glass bottle or jar and allow it to chill while you put together the salad. This will help the flavours get more pronounced and blend well. To make the salad, first wash all the salad greens and the parsley, mint, chopped spring onion greens. Dry them all in a salad spinner or by gently dabbing them between kitchen napkins. I used red veined sorrel, however you could use romaine lettuce or gem lettuce or any other salad greens that are easily available to you, instead. Set the greens aside. Cut the pita bread into small triangular shaped pieces (chips) and place them in a bowl. Drizzle some olive oil and sprinkle za'atar generously all over the pita bread. Toss the chips around in the bowl so they are well coated. Spread them out on a Baking Sheet and place them in a preheated oven to bake at 160 degrees C (320 degrees F) for 10 minutes to crisp. Take them out and set them aside to cool. Next, chop up the tomatoes into uneven chunks. Take a large salad bowl and mix all the salad ingredients together: first the salad greens, followed by the thinly sliced red and white radishes, tomatoes, scallion bulbs, cucumber slices. Then, sprinkle some salt over it and mix gently. Add the pita chips to the salad too and drizzle the pomegranate pods over the salad. The next step is to prepare the Pomegranate Molasses. It is important to ensure that this is the last step, shortly before serving the fattoush. To make the molasses, use a ratio of 8:1 for the pomegranate juice and sugar. In a saucepan, add the sugar, pomegranate juice and lemon juice and cook on high heat for about 2 minutes (or less), swirling it together, till the sugar dissolves. At this stage, reduce the heat and continue to cook the syrup for about 5 minutes till the liquid is syrupy and begins to thicken, becoming jelly like. It will be very, very, hot at this stage so take care while stirring. When the molasses begins to look thick, you need to quickly turn off the heat. At this stage you must keep the molasses moderately warm as it tends to thicken and solidify as it cools. To do this, place the saucepan in a wide bowl or warm water. The next step is to serve the salad. It is best to serve individual servings, to keep the entire salad from going soggy. To do this, portion out individual servings of the chopped vegetables. Drizzle each serving with 1 tablespoon of the lemon-olive oil dressing and 2 teaspoons of pomegranate molasses. Sprinkle a little sumac and serve. This salad would make a delightful accompaniment to  (a hearty Persian stew) and  ..\nSummary: This recipe belongs to the nan cuisine and is typically served as nan.\nIt is a nan dish that uses Red Radish, Tomatoes, Cherry tomatoes among other ingredients.\nReference: https://www.archanaskitchen.com/fattoush-with-za-atar-sumac-and-pomegranate-molasses"

Knead it once again and divide the dough into 10 to 12 portions and keep the portions covered to prevent them from drying. Method for the filling Heat one teaspoon of oil in a pan; add the cumin seeds and allow it to crackle. On low heat add the ginger and turmeric powder; after a few seconds add the potatoes, fennel seeds, garam masala, chaat masala, red chilli powder, amchur powder, black salt and regular salt.  Gently toss them so the potatoes get evenly coated with the spices.

Using a food processor helps to really simplify the process of grating and juicing.  Prefer not using the juicer, as much of the pulp gets wasted, instead use the blender to make a fine puree. First grate the turmeric, ginger and amla using a hand grater or food processor. If you don't have a food processor for grating, then simply chop the turmeric ginger and amla into tiny pieces and process as below to grind it. Add the grated turmeric, ginger and amla into the tall jar of the mixer grinder. Add one cup of water and blend to make a smooth paste. You might have to do it in two batches if the jar is not large enough to grind all of them in one turn. Using a strainer, press and strain out all the juice from the pulp. Place the pulp back into the blender jar, add more water and blend again for a few spins. Strain and extract more juice from the pulp. Do this another two or three times, by blending the pulp along with more water. This ensures we have taken out the maximum juice and potency from the turmeric, ginger and amla. You will approximately use 800 ml to 1 liter of water and get approximately 1 liter of juice.  The juice extracted will be of the right potency to consume. You will not have to dilute more to drink the Indonesian Jamu. Once you have extracted all the potent juice from the pulp, discard the pulp and keep the juice in a large container. Stir in the honey and black pepper powder until well combined. Give the Indonesian Jamu a taste and adjust accordingly. Store the Jamu in glass bottles in the refrigerator for upto a week.

Using a knife to remove their tip and lightly make 2-3 vertical cuts on each mango to help cook better. Take a sauce pan, cook the mangoes with sufficient water, until they are soft and cooked thoroughly on a medium high heat. When the color of the mango peel appears soft, you know they are cooked. It might take 10 minutes depending on the heat.  Switch off once done and drain water into a bowl (reserve for later) and keep the whole mangoes in the pan and allow the mangoes to cool till handleable. You can also keep the saucepan in a plate filled with cold water to fasten this process. Once the mangoes cool, peel them. You will be able to peel the mangoes easily using your fingers. Put the mango peels into the bowl with the reserved water and extract any more remaining pulp by squeezing with hand. Discard peel once done and reserve the water as you do. Now squeeze cooked mangoes with hands to make the curry pulpy, using a masher is difficult with fibrous pulp on the seed of mango.

Cooking Time: 30 M.\nIngredients: All Purpose Flour (Maida), Sugar, Salt, Lukewarm Water, Oil.\nInstructions: To begin making the Homemade Bread with yeast, first prep all your ingredients and keep them ready. Into a large mixing bowl or the bowl of the stand mixer, add the flour, salt, sugar and instant dry yeast. If you are using yeast that needs to be proofed, then you need to add it along with the wet ingredients. Combine the above dry ingredients well.  Add the water, oil (and here if using proofed yeast) and start mixing and kneading the dough until it becomes smooth. Knead well for about 10 to 15 minutes, this kneading process helps to develop gluten in the bread. At this stage the dough will be sticky - just allow it to be. Cover and rest for about 2 hours. The dough would have doubled its size. The next step is to do the 2nd rise. Grease two loaf pans of 9 x 4  or 9 x 5 Remove the dough and place it on a floured surface. Divide the dough into two and shape it into loaf.  Place the dough portions into the loaf pan and allow it to rise for another two hours. Once it has doubled in size, preheat the oven to 175 C. Place the homemade breads into the oven and bake for about 3o to 35 minutes until you notice the crust has a  golden brown color. Remove from the pan and immediately invert it into a cooling wire rack - when you tap the bread at the bottom it should sound little hollow. Allow the bread to cool for at least 10 to 15 minutes before you can cut and serve..\nSummary: This recipe belongs to the Continental cuisine and is typically served as World Breakfast.\nIt is a vegetarian dish that uses All Purpose Flour (Maida), Sugar, Salt among other ingredients.\nReference: https://www.archanaskitchen.com/basic-homemade-bread-recipe-using-yeast"

    "content": "Recipe: Homemade Quick Puff Pastry Sheet Recipe | Perfect For Puffs, Tarts & Pies..\nCuisine: Continental. Course: nan. Diet type: Vegetarian.\nCategory: Basic & Advanced Cooking Techniques. Preparation Time: 1440 M. Cooking Time: 0 M.\nIngredients: All Purpose Flour (Maida), Salt, Butter (unsalted), Chilled water.\nInstructions: To begin making the Quick Puff Pastry Recipe Sheet for making puffs, measure all the ingredients and keep them ready. Add flour and salt to a large mixing bowl and give a quick stir to combine it. Add the large cubes of butter into the flour mixture. Ensure each piece of butter is coated fully into flour. When it is coated in flour it will be less likely to melt and also less likely to melt out of the dough later when we roll to make the sheets. This process of covering the butter with flour is called lamination of the butter with flour. If it is not laminated well, the butter will melt out of the dough and you will end up with a puff that is not flaky.  Next, squish up the cubes of butter coated with flour by pressing between your fingers.  Like shown in the image below. Once all the pieces are squished, just toss them in flour once again. You need to ensure all the butter pieces are well coated with flour. Make a well in the center and add little ice water at a time. Starting with 1/3 cup and then adding more if required a tablespoon at a time. Because every single brand of flour absorbs moisture differently, we need to ensure we add that water little at a time.  To mix the water in, toss the flour into the water and it helps the water get incorporated to form the dough without kneading. Do not knead the dough, as it can activate too much gluten. When it gets to a stage where the puff pastry dough forms large clumps, you can knead a little to understand how much more moisture is needed to bring the dough together without breaking those butter shingles. Add a few tablespoons of water if needed again to bring the dry flour together to form the dough.  It is important to get the dough to the right hydration level. If it becomes too wet, then the dough will become sticky and might not be the best thing for puff pastry.  Gently press and bring the flour together to form a dough without kneading. It is important to work as quickly as possible. If you take too long and knead too long the heat from your hands will melt the butter and make it sticky.  We need to ensure that the butter is still in big pieces in the dough after bringing it together. The dough will look rough and not smooth and you will be able to see the big chunks of butter and will not look totally smooth. Divide the dough in two halves and shape each piece into an almost square disk. Wrap each disc of dough in a plastic/ cling film wrap and refrigerate for at least one hour. Based on the warmth and the humidity of the region, a minimum one hour will allow the dough to rest before we begin the folds to make the puff pastry sheet. After one hour, remove the dough from the refrigerator. Dust the working surface with very little flour.  Open one of the discs while the other is still in refrigeration.  First Round Roll out the dough into a rough rectangle shape to about 1/2 inch thickness. The dough will be tough, so use a little muscle to roll it out. If you feel the dough is sticky with butter, sprinkle a little bit of flour in the area where the butter feels sticky.  Ensure you dust off any excess flour. Once you have rolled it into a 1/2 inch thick rectangle, fold the dough into half and then fold the half into a quarter again. This is the first fold.  We will proceed to make the 2nd fold in the same round. Dust a little flour if required and roll into a 1/2 inch rectangle again and then do the folds (first into half and then again fold the half into a quarter). Wrap this dough the same cling wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to an hour until the dough is firm. Second Round After an hour, repeat the process mentioned in the first round again.  Once you are done with at least 3 to 4 rounds of rolling, folding and chilling process, the puff pastry dough is ready. You need to ensure you refrigerate the puff pastry dough for at least 6 to 8 hours before you are ready to use it to make puffs, tarts and more.  These puff pastry sheets can be stored in the freezer for up to 3 to 4 months. When you are ready to use them, thaw for 15 to 20 minutes at room temperature and begin using it for the recipes. .\nSummary: This recipe belongs to the Continental cuisine and is typically served as nan.\nIt is a vegetarian dish that uses All Purpose Flour (Maida), Salt, Butter (unsalted) among other ingredients.\nReference: https://www.archanaskitchen.com/homemade-quick-puff-pastry-sheet-recipe-perfect-for-puffs-tarts-pies"

Preparation Time: 20 M. Cooking Time: 40 M.\nIngredients: Whole Wheat Flour, Salt, Oil, Sweet corn, Green Chillies, Coriander (Dhania) Leaves, Cumin powder (Jeera), Salt.\nInstructions: To begin making the Stuffed Makai Paratha Recipe, we will first need to make the dough for the parathas. In a large bowl add in 2 cups of whole wheat flour and some salt. Use your fingers and stir in the salt into the flour. Add water a little at a time and knead to make soft, pliable dough. Knead dough for a couple of minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Use the fold press and knead motion to make the dough smooth. Next we will add a teaspoon of oil to coat the dough and knead little more. You want a dough that will be soft smooth and not sticky. Next we will divide the dough into 8 to 10 equal portions. Cover the dough and allow the dough to rest until you the filling ready. While the dough is resting, we will prepare the filling for the paratha. Into a  , add the steamed sweet corn, chopped green chillies, chopped coriander leaves and pulse to get a coarse mixture. Transfer this mixture to a mixing bowl; add the salt and cumin powder and stir well to combine. Check the salt and spice and adjust to suit your taste. Divide the filling into 8 to 10 equal portions. This process of dividing and keeping the portions of dough and filling ready, helps you gauge the number of makai parathas you can make and if you need more or less of the filling. Take a dough portion dust it in flour and flatten it on the rolling board by pressing it down. Roll the dough out into approximately 3 inch diameter circles dusting with flour in between to prevent the dough from sticking to the surface.  Now place the a portion of the filling onto the circle and bring the dough from the sides towards the center to cover the filling. Once the filling is sealed from the inside, flatten the dough, dust it in flour and and roll it gently to make a paratha.  Give it a gentle roll with the pin to even it out, if you press and roll too hard, there are chances the filing will come out. Proceed the same way with the remaining dough and filling portions. Now we will get into the final steps of cooking a Makai paratha, preheat a skillet on medium heat and place the filled dough. Allow it to cook on medium heat for about 30 to 45 seconds and flip over. Add this stage add a teaspoon of ghee or oil and spread it around. Flip again, so the oiled side can cook on the skillet. Spread a little more ghee and keep pressing the parathas while on the skillet to cook the paratha evenly from inside out. Do the flipping over process a couple of times until both sides get cooked, browned and crisp evenly. Make sure you cook on medium heat as it allows the makai parathas to get a crisp on the outside and yet soft texture. Once the paratha is cooked transfer to a plate. Continue to the remaining dough portions the same way. The Stuffed Makai Paratha makes a perfect breakfast or even a quick weeknight dinner that you can have along with a favorite Raita..\nSummary: This recipe belongs to the North Indian Recipes cuisine and is typically served as Dinner.\nIt is a diabetic friendly dish that uses Whole Wheat Flour, Salt, Oil among other ingredients.\nReference: https://www.archanaskitchen.com/stuffed-makai-paratha-recipe-corn-and-coriander-stuffed-flat-bread"
