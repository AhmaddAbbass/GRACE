# **GRACE — Graph Reasoning & Algorithm Composition Engine**

*A traversal-first assistant that answers, explains, and composes using graphs of algorithms.*

GRACE is a multi-domain platform that organizes **algorithms as knowledge graphs** and uses those graphs to answer questions, explain solutions, and even **compose new algorithms**. Each domain—e.g., **cooking**, **computer science**, **IKEA assembly**—gets its own graph. In a GRACE graph, **nodes** are meaningful units (steps, functions, tools, variables, resources) and **edges** capture relations (calls, depends-on, transforms, produces, precondition-of, part-of). An individual algorithm appears as a **path/subgraph** (e.g., *boil → cool → peel* for eggs; or *partition → recurse → merge* for sorting). Cross-algorithm links let GRACE stitch ideas from A, B, and C when solving something new.

At query time, the **GRACE Orchestrator** routes your question to the most relevant graph(s) and retrieves **local subgraphs** (entity-centric neighborhoods, multi-hop paths) plus **global structure** (communities/themes). That graph context is packaged—optionally with **web search results**—for the LLM, which produces a solution/plan and **cites** its provenance directly to graph nodes and original text snippets. The output isn’t just an answer; it’s an answer with a visible **why-path** you can inspect, learn from, and reuse.

Under the hood, GRACE’s ingestion pipeline converts text sources (docs, recipes, code, manuals) into graph structure. It extracts steps/functions, identifies inputs/outputs and pre/postconditions, and adds edges like *calls*, *uses*, *requires*, *produces*. It also connects **reusable motifs across algorithms** (e.g., “priority-queue selection” in Dijkstra ↔ “task scheduling” in cooking mise en place) so GRACE can transfer ideas. Over time, these graphs become a living library of **algorithmic motifs** that can be recombined: sometimes to propose a **new composition** (“Algorithm C”) and sometimes to explain **trade-offs** between alternatives.

**UI (GRACE Console).** Split view: on the **left**, a chat with the agent (ask “How do I cook a jammy egg?” or “Design a stable, O(n log n) sort for nearly-sorted arrays”); on the **right**, an interactive **graph visualization** showing what GRACE used—highlighted nodes/edges, the traversed subgraph, and links back to source snippets. Click any node to read the exact chunk it came from, expand neighborhoods, or pin alternatives. This makes GRACE **explainable** (clear provenance), **educational** (see solution structure), and **extensible** (edit or add nodes).

### What GRACE enables

* **Graph-aware retrieval:** multi-hop reasoning, community summaries, and entity-centric neighborhoods—richer than naive chunk search.
* **Composition & transfer:** reuse steps from different algorithms to draft a new plan, with constraints (types/preconditions) checked.
* **Provenance by design:** every claim maps to nodes/edges and the source texts; answers cite A/B/C so users can verify and learn.
* **Cross-domain utility:** the same pattern works for cooking, CS algorithms, and assembly instructions—anywhere procedures and relations matter.

**Examples.**
*Cooking*: “Jammy egg in 8 minutes?” → retrieves subgraph (boil→rest→cool→peel), shows timing nodes and safety notes; suggests variants (steam vs boil).
*CS*: “Fast edit distance for near-matches” → pulls DP subgraph and suggests banded DP; cites where *banding* appears in string-matching literature; shows complexity nodes.
*IKEA*: “Assemble LACK table” → step graph with *requires tool*, *depends-on*, *safety* edges; highlights common subroutines reused from other furniture.

**Stretch capabilities (planned):** typed contracts on nodes (inputs/outputs, pre/postconditions) with lightweight checking so compositions are valid; rewrite rules to explore equivalent subgraphs (choose best by a cost model); property-based tests on synthesized plans; agentic web-search augmentation with strict citation.

### Drop-in prompt (use with GRACE)

```
You are GRACE — the Graph Reasoning & Algorithm Composition Engine.

Use:
1) a knowledge graph of algorithms (nodes: steps/functions/tools/variables with types and pre/postconditions; edges: calls/depends-on/produces/part-of/precondition-of),
2) retrieved subgraphs and community summaries ("context"),
3) optional web search results.

Task: Given the user's query {query}, use {context} (graph nodes/edges + source snippets) and {search_results} to produce a clear solution or algorithmic plan.
- Explain your reasoning with references to specific graph nodes/edges (ID or label).
- Cite sources (graph nodes with their original text snippets, and web sources if used).
- Prefer stepwise, verifiable instructions and state assumptions/preconditions.
- If multiple valid approaches exist, compare them and note trade-offs.
```
